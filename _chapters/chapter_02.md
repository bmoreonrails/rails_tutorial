{% list %}
  1.  Open Terminal and `cd` to `Projects/bookstore` from your home directory.

      If you have Terminal open from the previous chapter, you should already be in `HOME/Projects/bookstore`. Remember how to check what directory you're in?

      (`pwd`)

  1.  Run `rails generate model book`.

      This generated a few files, but there are only a couple we're interesed in.

  1.  Run `ls -l db/migrate`. You should see a file named something like `20161115030350_create_books.rb`.

      20161115030350 is a timestamp generated when the file is created. You're file will start with a more recent timestamp...I hope :)

      Let's take a look at this file in your text editor.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ pwd
  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore

  $ rails generate model book
        invoke  active_record
        create    db/migrate/20161115030350_create_books.rb
        create    app/models/book.rb
        invoke    test_unit
        create      test/models/book_test.rb
        create      test/fixtures/books.yml

  $ ls -l db/migrate

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Open the `bookstore` directory in your text editor and open `db/migrate/YOUR_TIMESTAMP_create_books.rb`.

  1.  This is a migration file called `CreateBooks`. Migrations are used to make changes to the database.

  1.  On line 3 of the `CreateBooks` migration, there's a block called `create_table`. Inside this block, you'll make changes to add columns to the new `books` table.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      create_table :books do |t|

        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  The `books` table will need a few columns.

      It will need a string column to store book titles and another string column to store book authors.

      The table will also need a column to store book prices. Since keeping track of money can be tricky, the column will need to be an integer where book prices can be stored in cents. It sounds weird, but you'll have to trust me on this one.

  1.  After line 3 of the `CreateBooks` migration, add the following:

      ```ruby
      t.string :title
      t.string :author
      t.integer :price_cents
      ```

  1.  You've added a few things to the `create_table` block, but you might've noticed that there was already some code in there:

      ```ruby
      t.timestamps
      ```

      What's `t.timestamps` doing? It's a convinence method added by Rails that will add two more columns to the `books` table: `created_at` and `updated_at`. They'll be used to store the time when books are created and updated.

  1.  Save your changes to the `CreateBooks` migration and go back to Terminal.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      create_table :books do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.string :author
        t.integer :price_cents
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  In Terminal, make sure you're in the `bookstore` directory.

  1.  Run `rake db:migrate`.

  1.  Yay! You've just run your first migration!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ pwd
  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore

  $ rake db:migrate
  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrating ======================================
  -- create_table(:books)
     -> 0.0030s
  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrated (0.0034s) =============================
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  The migration was just one of the files that was generated by `rails generate model book`. It also generated another file: `app/models/book.rb`. Let's take a quick look at it.

  1.  Open the `bookstore` directory in your text editor, and open `app/models/book.rb`.

  1.  It might not look very exciting, but it's actually pretty powerful. We now have a `Book` class. The `Book` class is used to represent individual rows in the `books` table.

      Still not impressed? Let's see what you can do with this class.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class Book < ApplicationRecord
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Open Terminal and make sure your in the `bookstore` directory.

  1.  Run `rails console`. This will open...the `rails console`.

      The `rails console` is available in all Rails applications. It let's you play around with the different things in your applications.

  1.  Now that you're in the `rails console`, let's see what we can do with `Book`s.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ pwd
  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore

  $ rails console
  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)
  >>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Let's try creating my favorite book.

  1.  In the `rails console`, run the following code:

      ```ruby
      my_favorite_book = Book.new
      ```

      This will create a new instance of `Book` that we can refer to as `my_favorite_book`.

  1.  Now, give `my_favorite_book` a title. Run:

      ```ruby
      my_favorite_book.title = "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"
      ```

  1.  `my_favorite_book` now has a title. Don't belive me?! Try running
      `my_favorite_book.title`. It should return "why's (poignant) Guide to
      Ruby".
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> my_favorite_book = Book.new
  => #<Book id: nil, title: nil, author: nil, price_cents: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
  >> my_favorite_book.title = "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"
  => "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"
  >> my_favorite_book.title
  => "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Remember those other columns we added to the `books` table? We can set those on `my_favorite_book`.

      For example, "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby" was written by why the lucky stiff. Try setting `my_favorite_book`'s author to "why the lucky stiff".

  1.  Although `my_favorite_book` is priceless, you can go ahead and give it a price. Remember, we named this column `price_cents`.

  1.  We should probably keep track of the number of copies we have of my favorite book. Run the following code to set the quantity:

      ```ruby
      my_favorite_book.quantity = 500
      ```

  1.  Did that work? No?!

      Welcome to your first error!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> my_favorite_book.author = "why the lucky stiff"
  => "why the lucky stiff"
  >> my_favorite_book.price_cents = 100
  => 100
  >> my_favorite_book.quantity = 500

  1.  We tried setting quantity on `my_favorite_book`, but we got an error:

      ```ruby
      NoMethodError: undefined method `quantity=' for #<Book:0x007fdc9453bf60>
      ```

  1.  We get a `NoMethodError` for `quantity=` because `quantity` isn't a attribute we can set on `Book`.

  1.  If you remember the `CreateBooks` migration, we added a few columns, but we never added a column for `quantity`. Let's fix this!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      create_table :books do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.string :author
        t.integer :price_cents
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Your database is currently in a bad state. The `books` table needs a `quantity` column to store the number of available books. Fortunately, we have a few ways to fix this.

  1.  Migrations are designed to run in two directions. So far, we've run the `CreateBooks` migration "up" to add the `books` table.

      Now, we're going to run the `CreateBooks` migration "down". By running the migration "down", the `books` table will be removed. With the table no longer in the database, we can make changes to the migration and re-run it so the `books` table has the `quantity` column.

  1.  First, exit the `rails console` by running `exit`.

  1.  Then, run the `CreateBooks` migration down by running `rake db:rollback`.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  >> exit

  $ rake db:rollback
  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: reverting ======================================
  -- drop_table(:books)
     -> 0.0098s
  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: reverted (0.0143s) =============================
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Go back to your text editor and open the `CreateBooks` migration.

  1.  Inside the `create_table` block, add the following line:

      ```ruby
      t.integer :quantity
      ```

  1.  Save your changes to the `CreateBooks` migration.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      create_table :books do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.string :author
        t.integer :price_cents
        t.timestamps
        t.integer :quantity
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}

  1. <p>Go back to your terminal and re-run the migration by running `rake db:migrate`.</p>
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ rake db:migrate
  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrating ======================================
  -- create_table(:books)
     -> 0.0415s
  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrated (0.0416s) =============================
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now that your `books` table has the `quantity` column, you can go back to adding my favorite book :)

  1.  Enter the `rails console` by running...`rails console`.

  1.  You already forgot what my favorite book was, didn't you?

      No worries - just run the following code in your console to refresh your memory:

      ```ruby
      my_favorite_book = Book.new
      my_favorite_book.title = "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"
      my_favorite_book.author = "why the lucky stiff"
      my_favorite_book.price_cents = 100
      ```

  1.  Ok, now that you have my favorite book again try adding the quantity:

      ```ruby
      my_favorite_book.quantity = 500
      ```

  1.  Alright, my favorite book is coming along nicely. I think we're ready to save it to your database.

      Run `my_favorite_book.save` to save my favorite book to your database.

  1.  If the last thing you see says `true`, my favorite books has been saved to your database. Yay!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> my_favorite_book = Book.new
  => #<Book id: nil, title: nil, author: nil, price_cents: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, quantity: nil>

  >> my_favorite_book.title = "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"
  => "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"

  >> my_favorite_book.author = "why the lucky stiff"
  => "why the lucky stiff"

  >> my_favorite_book.price_cents = 100
  => 100

  >> my_favorite_book.quantity = 500
  => 500

  >> my_favorite_book.save
     (0.1ms)  begin transaction
    SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO "books" ("title", "author", "price_cents", "created_at", "updated_at", "quantity") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["title", "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby"], ["author", "why the lucky stiff"], ["price_cents", 100], ["created_at", 2016-11-24 03:30:53 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-11-24 03:30:53 UTC], ["quantity", 500]]
     (2.3ms)  commit transaction
  => true
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now that you've used the `save` method to save a book to your database, let me show you another way to save a book to your database!

  1.  Let's try using the `create` method to add my second favorite book to your database.

      Run the following code on the rails console:

      ```ruby
      Book.create(title: "Oh, the Places You'll Go!", author: "Dr. Seuss", price_cents: 500, quantity: 200)
      ```

  1.  The `create` method lets us save data in a single command. Instead of setitng attributes one at a time, we can set them all at once.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> Book.create(title: "Oh, the Places You'll Go!", author: "Dr. Seuss", price_cents: 500, quantity: 200)
     (0.1ms)  begin transaction
    SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO "books" ("title", "author", "price_cents", "created_at", "updated_at", "quantity") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["title", "Oh, the Places You'll Go!"], ["author", "Dr. Seuss"], ["price_cents", 500], ["created_at", 2016-11-24 03:33:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-11-24 03:33:22 UTC], ["quantity", 200]]
     (3.7ms)  commit transaction
  => #<Book id: 2, title: "Oh, the Places You'll Go!", author: "Dr. Seuss", price_cents: 500, created_at: "2016-11-24 03:33:22", updated_at: "2016-11-24 03:33:22", quantity: 200>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now that we've added some books to your database, let's try pulling them out of the database.

  1.  My second favorite book was the last book you added to your database. To get it, run `Book.last` on the rails console.

  1.  My favorite book was the first book you added. Can you guess how we would get it?

      Run `Book.first` to get the first book in your database.

  1.  What if you wanted to see all the books in your database? How would you do that??

      Run `Book.all` to get all the books in your database.

  1.  Programming can be really confusing, but every once in a while it kinda makes sense :)
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> Book.last
    Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books" ORDER BY "books"."id" DESC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  => #<Book id: 2, title: "Oh, the Places You'll Go!", author: "Dr. Seuss", price_cents: 500, created_at: "2016-11-24 03:33:22", updated_at: "2016-11-24 03:33:22", quantity: 200>

  >> Book.first
    Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books" ORDER BY "books"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  => #<Book id: 1, title: "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby", author: "why the lucky stiff", price_cents: 100, created_at: "2016-11-24 03:30:53", updated_at: "2016-11-24 03:30:53", quantity: 500>

  >> Book.all
    Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books"
  => #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Book id: 1, title: "why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby", author: "why the lucky stiff", price_cents: 100, created_at: "2016-11-24 03:30:53", updated_at: "2016-11-24 03:30:53", quantity: 500>, #<Book id: 2, title: "Oh, the Places You'll Go!", author: "Dr. Seuss", price_cents: 500, created_at: "2016-11-24 03:33:22", updated_at: "2016-11-24 03:33:22", quantity: 200>]>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  As happy as I am to see some of my favorite books in your bookstore, I'm sure you have some you'd like to add as well.

  1.  Add five more books to your bookstore.

  1.  When you're done, run `Book.count` to get the total number of books in your database. It should return 7.

  1.  After you've added five more books and verified that they are saved to your database, exit the rails console by running `exit`.
{% endlist %}
{% endsteps %}
