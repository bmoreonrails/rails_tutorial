Your bookstore is full of wonderful books. Although they have some great descriptions, your books deserve great advocates!

Your books need reviews. ðŸ˜‰
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  Before we can add reviews, we need a place to store them. Let's add a new table to your database.

  1.  Open Terminal and go to your `bookstore` directory.

  1.  Now, run `rails generate model review`.

      You might remember running this command when we created the books table.

      `rails generate model review` creates a bunch of files.

      ```shell
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20170103220053_create_reviews.rb
      create    app/models/review.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/review_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/reviews.yml
      ```

      The first file it creates is a migration file. We've already created a few of these in your bookstore application.

      ```shell
      $ ls -l db/migrate
      total 24
      -rw-r--r--  1 alimi  staff  230 Dec 30 12:00 20161115030350_create_books.rb
      -rw-r--r--  1 alimi  staff  125 Dec 30 12:00 20161227020938_add_description_to_books.rb
      ```

      Migration files always have file names that start with the timestamp of when they were created.

      Let's take a look at the migration that was generated by `rails generate model review`.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ pwd
  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore

  $ rails generate model review
        invoke  active_record
        create    db/migrate/20170103220053_create_reviews.rb
        create    app/models/review.rb
        invoke    test_unit
        create      test/models/review_test.rb
        create      test/fixtures/reviews.yml
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  In your text editor, open the `CreateReviews` migration (`db/migrations/TIMESTAMP_create_reviews.rb`).

  1.  Take a look at the `change` method. It has a `create_table` block that will create the `reviews` table.

      ```ruby
      def change
        create_table :reviews do |t|

          t.timestamps
        end
      end
      ```

      If you ran the migration as it is now, your `reviews` table wouldn't have anything other than the `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps. We'll need to change the `create_table` block so your new `reviews` table can store more review related data. ðŸ˜„
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class CreateReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      create_table :reviews do |t|

        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  The `reviews` table will need a column to store the text of a review. Let's call that column `body`, and let's make it a `text` column so you can leave long, inspiring reviews.

  1.  Using your other migrations as an example, update the `create_table` block of your `CreateReviews` migration to add a `text` column called `body` to your `reviews` table.

  1.  When you're done, save your changes, and run the migration by running `rake db:migrate`.

      If you make any mistakes, you can always undo the migration by running `rake db:rollback`. Then, you can make changes to your `CreateReviews` migration and re-run it with `rake db:migrate`.
{% endlist %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  How did you update the migration?

      You needed to add one line to the `create_table` block.

      ```ruby
      t.text :body
      ```

  1.  If you didn't already, add this line to your migration.

      If you ran the migration without adding the `body` column, you'll need to rollback and re-run the migration.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class CreateReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      create_table :reviews do |t|
        t.text :body

        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  Now that we have reviews, let's play with them on the `rails console`.

  1.  Go to Terminal and start the `rails console`.

  1.  You now have a new object you can use: `Review`.

      Try running `Review.new`. It will return a new, empty `Review`.

      ```ruby
      #<Review id: nil, body: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
      ```

      In addition to id, created_at, and updated_at, the new review also has a body.

  1.  Using the `Review` class, create two reviews.

      The same methods you used to create books can be used to create reviews.

      When you're done `Review.count` should return 2.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  $ rails console
  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)

  >> Review.new
  => #<Review id: nil, body: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Did you create two reviews? How did you do it?

      Maybe you created a review by using `create`.

      ```ruby
      Review.create(body: "Wow, what a great book!")
      ```

      Or maybe you started with a `new` review and called `save` on it.

      ```ruby
      a_new_review = Review.new
      a_new_review.body = "10/10 would recommend"
      a_new_review.save
      ```

      You might've even come up with something totally different!

      ![Somebody's impressed]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/impressed.gif)

  1.  If you get 2 when you run `Review.count`, yay!

      If not, use either of the methods we described to create two reviews.
{% endlist %}
{% endsteps %}

{% aside %}
### Associating Reviews to Books

Now you have a couple of reviews, but doesn't it feel like we're missing something?

*How are these reviews related to books?*

They're not ðŸ˜…

Fortunately, Rails gives us a few tools to associate reviews to books.

In this case, we can say a review should only belong to one book. This is called a `belongs_to` relationship.

Let's define the `belongs_to` relationship.
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  In your text editor, open `app/models/review.rb`.

  1.  Inside the `Review` class, add the following line.

      ```ruby
      belongs_to :book
      ```

      With this change, we're setting up your application so a `Review` `belongs_to` a `Book`.

  1.  Save your changes.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class Review < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :book
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Go back to the `rails console` and run `reload!` to pick up your changes.

  1.  Now, get your first review from the database and assign it to a variable called `my_first_review`.

      ```ruby
      my_first_review = Review.first
      ```

  1.  Let's try to get `my_first_review`'s book.

      Run `my_first_review.book`.

      That returned nil because `my_first_review` was never associated with a book.

  1.  Let's try assigning your first book to your first review.

      Run the following:

      ```ruby
      my_first_review.book = Book.first
      ```

      That returned an error, didn't it? ðŸ™ƒ

  1.  It might be hard to see, but you actually got a pretty useful error...

      ```ruby
      ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: can't write unknown attribute `book_id`
      ```

      We've defined the `belongs_to` relationship between review and book, but we need a way to save that relationship in your database. To do that, we'll need to add a `book_id` column to your `reviews` table.

  1.  Let's make that change to the `reviews` table, but before you move on exit the `rails console`.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> reload!
  Reloading...
  => true

  >> my_first_review = Review.first
    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "reviews".* FROM "reviews" ORDER BY "reviews"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  => #<Review id: 1, body: "Wow, what a great book!", created_at: "2017-01-04 02:07:50", updated_at: "2017-01-04 02:07:50">

  >> my_first_review.book
  => nil

  >> my_first_review.book = Book.first
    Book Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books" ORDER BY "books"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: can't write unknown attribute `book_id`
  ...

  >> exit
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  To add a `book_id` column to the `reviews` table, we'll need a new migration.

  Remember, editing an old migration would mean rolling back that migration and we don't want to do that because that would delete the data in the database.

  1.  In Terminal, run `rails generate migration add_book_id_to_reviews`.

      This will generate a new timestamped migration called `AddBookIdToReviews`.

  1.  Do you remember when you added `description` to the `books` table?

      ```ruby
      class AddDescriptionToBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
        def change
          add_column :books, :description, :text
        end
      end
      ```

      We'll want to do something similiar to add the `book_id` column to the `reviews` table.

  1.  Open the `AddBookIdToReviews` migration in your text editor (`db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_add_book_id_to_reviews.rb`).

  1.  Using the `AddDescriptionToBooks` migration as an example, update the `AddBookIdToReviews` migration so a `book_id` column is added to the `reviews` table. The `book_id` column should be an `integer` column.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ rails generate migration add_book_id_to_reviews
        invoke  active_record
        create    db/migrate/20170104024335_add_book_id_to_reviews.rb
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  What does your solution look like?

      Inside the `change` method, you should have the following line:

      ```ruby
      add_column :reviews, :book_id, :integer
      ```

      This will add a `book_id` column to the `reviews` table, and the new column will be an integer column.

  1.  Update your soultion to match this solution and save your changes.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class AddBookIdToReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      add_column :reviews, :book_id, :integer
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now go back to Terminal and run your migration!

      ```shell
      rake db:migrate
      ```

  1.  If you pay close attention to the output, you can see the `book_id` column getting added to the `reviews` table.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ rake db:migrate
  == 20170104024335 AddBookIdToReviews: migrating ===============================
  -- add_column(:reviews, :book_id, :integer)
     -> 0.0073s
  == 20170104024335 AddBookIdToReviews: migrated (0.0074s) ======================
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  Now that the `reviews` table has a `book_id` column, you can assign books to reviews. Let's try it!

  1.  Open `rails console` and run the following code to assign your first book to your first review.

      ```ruby
      my_first_review = Review.first
      my_first_review.book = Book.first
      my_first_review.save
      ```

  1.  Now, try running `my_first_review.book`.

      Yay! ðŸŽ‰

      Your first review is now associated with your first book.

      If you look at `my_first_review`, you'll notice its `book_id` is 1 - your first book's id.

  1.  Go ahead and assign your second review to your first book. While you're at it, also create another review for your first book.

      When you're done, `Review.count` should return 3.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  $ rails console
  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)
  >> my_first_review = Review.first
    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "reviews".* FROM "reviews" ORDER BY "reviews"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  => #<Review id: 1, body: "Wow, what a great book!", created_at: "2017-01-04 02:07:50", updated_at: "2017-01-04 02:07:50", book_id: nil>

### A Book Has Many Reviews

Your first book now has multiple reviews.

We can find which review a book belongs to, but we can't find all the reviews a book has.

Or can we???

![Wink wink]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wink.gif)

Since a book can have many reviews, we can define a `has_many` relationship between books and reviews.
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  In your text editor, open `app/models/book.rb`, and add the followling line inside the class

      ```ruby
      has_many :reviews
      ```

      This will set up your application so a `Book` `has_many` `Review`s.

      In addition, we won't have to make any database changes because the `reviews` table already has a `book_id` column. The relationship is already defined in the database.

  1.  Save your changes.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class Book < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :reviews
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now, go back to the `rails console` and run `reload!` to get you newest changes.

  1.  Get your first book and assign it to `my_first_book`.

  1.  Now, try running `my_first_book.reviews`.

      It might be hard to see, but all your book reviews are there!

      ![Dancing Banana]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dancing-banana.gif)

  1.  Don't believe me??

      Try running `my_first_book.reviews.count`. It should return 3.

  1.  Spend some time playing around with this relationship. You can do things like `my_first_book.reviews.first` or `my_first_book.reviews.pluck(:body)`.

      To find a complete list of all the things you can do, take a look at the documentation [here](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.0/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/CollectionProxy.html).

  1.  When your done exploring, exit the `rails console`.

  >> my_first_book.reviews.count
     (0.4ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "reviews" WHERE "reviews"."book_id" = ?  [["book_id", 1]]
  => 3

  >> exit
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% aside %}
### The magic that is a Relational Database!  
Are you starting to see how we're using Rails to build a relational database? 

So far, you've built two tables: a `books` table and a `reviews` table. Those tables are connected to one another by the `book_id` column on the Reviews table. That column is making it possible for books to have many reviews in our database.
