  Throughout the tutorial, you're going to run a lot of Terminal commands. For example, we might ask you to do something like

  > Run `pwd` to print your current working directory.

  To run the command, you'll need to type it in Terminal and hit `enter` to execute it.
{% endprotip%}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Open Terminal.

  1.  You're now in your home directory. Run `ls` to see what's in your home directory. You might see some familiar directories like `Desktop`, `Documents`, and `Music`.

  1.  All code deserves a good home. Add a new `Projects` directory to your home directory by running `mkdir Projects`.

  1.  Navigate to your new `Projects` directory by running `cd Projects`.

  1.  Now you're ready to create the bookstore!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  > ls
  Desktop Document Music

  > mkdir Projects

  > cd Projects
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

  Before you can complete the following list, your computer needs to be configured with Rails. If you haven't already, please refer to the [install instructions](link) for list on configuring your computer.
{% endprotip %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  In your `Projects` directory, run `rails new bookstore`.

  1.  `rails new` does a lot of stuff! First, it creates the files and directories that make up the basic structure of your bookstore application. Then, it runs `bundle install` to install the dependencies needed to run the application.

  1.  After `rails new` finishes, run `cd bookstore` to navigate to the newly created bookstore application.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  > rails new bookstore
        create
        create  README.md
        create  Rakefile
        create  config.ru
        create  .gitignore
        create  Gemfile
        create  app

  1.  Let's take a look the files that got created.

  1.  Run `ls -l` to list out all the top level files and directories `rails new` generated. There is lot going on, but a few things stand out.

  1.  Any code that is specific to the bookstore application will live in the `app` directory. Run `ls -l app` to take a look at the some of the things you'll be working with throughout the tutorial.

  Don't have a favorite text editor for programming? We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).
{% endprotip %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  The `config` directory is where you'll store configuration files for the bookstore application. `rails new` generated a bunch of configuration files to help you get this new application up and running quickly. Let's take a look at one of those files.

  1.  Use your favorite text editor to open the `bookstore` directory.

  1.  In your text editor, open the `config` directory, and then open `database.yml`.

  1.  `database.yml` tells Rails how to connect to the bookstore application's database.

  1.  By default, the bookstore application is setup to use [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/). It's a light weight database that's perfect for this tutorial.

  1.  Since we're happy with the default `database.yml` generated by `rails new`, we can live it as is. Ah, [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).
{% endlist %}

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
  # config/database.yml

  # SQLite version 3.x
  #   gem install sqlite3
  #
  #   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
  #   gem 'sqlite3'
  #
  default: &default
    adapter: sqlite3
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000

  development:
    <<: *default
    database: db/development.sqlite3

  # Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
  # re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
  # Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
  test:
    <<: *default
    database: db/test.sqlite3

  production:
    <<: *default
    database: db/production.sqlite3
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% aside %}
  Not sure what a database is? Don't worry, we'll fill you in :)

  Brief description with external resources if we think this is necessary.

 Don't worry if what you're seeing doesn't look exactly like the examples we've included in the tutorial. Small things can change between different versions of Rails.
{% endprotip %}

  1.  There are plenty of things to look at, but we'll get to them later. For now, let's get the application running!

  1.  Go back to Terminal and make sure you're in the `bookstore` directory.

      Not sure if you're in the `bookstore` directory? Run `pwd` to see what directory you're in. You should see something like `/Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore`.

  1.  Now run `rails server` to start the application server. It will tell you how to access the running application:

      ```ruby
      => Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on
      http://localhost:3000
      ```

 1.  Open you web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  › pwd
  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore

  > rails server
  => Booting Puma
  => Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
  => Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
  Puma starting in single mode...

  * Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
  * Environment: development
  * Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
  Use Ctrl-C to stop

  1.  Yay! The bookstore application is running!

  1.  Go back to Terminal, and you can see the application responding to requests.

  1.  Now that you're back in Terminal, run `Ctrl-C`to stop the application.

  What's this bookstore we keep talking about? In this tutorial, we're going to use Rails to make an application for a bookstore.

  As you build the application, you'll add features to create, view, edit, and delete books. Since we all have feelings on the books we love...and hate, you'll add features so books can be reviewed by users.

  By creating an application for a bookstore, you'll get explore the different layers of Rails.

  Are you ready?!
