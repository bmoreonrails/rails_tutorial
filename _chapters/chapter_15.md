{% aside %}
  Now that you can keep track of logged in users, you can keep track of their actions. A great example where this could be useful is with your reviews. Wouldn't it be nice to know which users are leaving which reviews?
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  To track which users are leaving which reviews, we need to establish a relationship between users and reviews.

      A user can leave many reviews, and a review can only be written by one user. Does this sound familiar?

  1.  You've already defined a similar relaltionship between books and reviews.

      ```ruby
      class Book < ApplicationRecord
        has_many :reviews
      end
      ```

      ```ruby
      class Review < ApplicationRecord
        belongs_to :book
      end
      ```

      A book has many reviews, and a review belongs to a book.

  1.  Open the `User` class (`app/models/user.rb`) in your text editor.

      Using the `Book` class as an example, update `User` so a user has many reviews.
{% endlist %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  What do your changes look like? You should have added the following line to `User`:

      ```ruby
      has_many :reviews
      ```

  1.  If you didn't already, make this change to `User`.

  1.  Save your changes.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class User < ApplicationRecord
    has_secure_password

    has_many :reviews
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now that we've defined a relationship between users and reviews, let's see what we can do with it on the `rails console`.

  1.  Open Terminal, make sure you're in the `bookstore` directory, and start the `rails console`.

  1.  Find your first user and assign it to a variable called `my_first_user`.

  1.  Now, try running `my_first_user.reviews`.

  1.  Yikes! That looks like a gnarly error... 😅

      The `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` error is giving you hint to what's going on. Burried inside the error, you have this message:

      ```ruby
      no such column: reviews.user_id
      ```

      We've defined the relationship between users and reviews on the model level, but we haven't defined it on the database level.

      Since we said a user can have many reviews, Rails is expecting the reviews table to have a `user_id` column. Let's add it!

  1.  Before you continue, exit the `rails console`.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  $ pwd
  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore
  $ rails console
  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)

  >> my_first_user = User.first
    User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  => #<User id: 1, username: "CatPower", password_digest: "$2a$10$T9KFCyIrtgFhBtEixMYm9e757ZXa7UlBVOyaAzCtbwt...", created_at: "2017-01-13 02:57:39", updated_at: "2017-01-13 02:57:39">

  >> my_first_user.reviews
    Review Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "reviews".* FROM "reviews" WHERE "reviews"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]
  ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: reviews.user_id: SELECT "reviews".* FROM "reviews" WHERE "reviews"."user_id" = ?
  ...

  >> exit
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  To add a `user_id` column to the `reviews` table, we'll need to create a new migration.

  1.  In Terminal, run the following command:

      ```shell
      rails generate migration add_user_id_to_reviews
      ```

      This will generate a new timestamped migration file named `AddUserIdtoReviews`. It's filename will be something along the lines of `db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_add_user_id_to_reviews.rb`
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
  $ rails generate migration add_user_id_to_reviews
        invoke  active_record
        create    db/migrate/20170124223830_add_user_id_to_reviews.rb
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  The `AddUserIdtoReviews` migration will be very similiar to another migration you've created. Can you think of which one?

  1.  `AddUserIdtoReviews` is gonna look a lot like `AddBookIdToReviews`.

      ```ruby
      class AddBookIdToReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
        def change
          add_column :reviews, :book_id, :integer
        end
      end
      ```

      You added a `book_id` column to the `reviews` table because you wanted to define the relationship between books and reviews on the database level. Remember, a book can have many reviews.

      We want to do the same thing in `AddUserIdtoReviews`, except we're adding a `user_id` to `reviews`.

  1.  Using this as an example, update the `change` method of the `AddUserIdtoReviews` migration to add a `user_id` column to the `reviews` table. The `user_id` column should be an integer column.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  class AddUserIdToReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  What does your change look like? You should've added the following line to the `change` method:

      ```ruby
      add_column :reviews, :user_id, :integer
      ```

  1.  If you didn't already, add this line, save your changes, and run the migration.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  class AddUserIdToReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
    def change
      add_column :reviews, :user_id, :integer
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now that we've defined the relationship between users and reviews on both the model **and** the database levels, we can go back to exploring the relationship on the `rails console`.

  1.  Go to Terminal and start the `rails console`.

  1.  Assign your first user to a variable called `my_first_user`.

  1.  Now, try running `my_first_user.reviews`.  

      You get an empty collection because `my_first_user` doesn't have any reviews. Let's change that!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  $ rails console
  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)
  >> my_first_user = User.first
    User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]

  >> my_first_user.reviews
    Review Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "reviews".* FROM "reviews" WHERE "reviews"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]
  => #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Assign your first book to a variable called `my_first_book`.

  1.  Now, run the following code to create a new review for `my_first_book` that will also be associated with `my_first_user`.

      ```ruby
      my_first_book.reviews.create(body: "This review was written by a user!", user_id: my_first_user.id)
      ```

      On the new review, we're setting a `body` and a `user_id`.

      By setting the `user_id` to `my_first_user`'s id, we'll know that the review belongs to `my_first_user`.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> my_first_book = Book.first
    Book Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books" ORDER BY "books"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now that `my_first_user` has a review, try running `my_first_user.reviews` again.

      *I thought `my_first_user` would have reviews* 😔

      But `my_first_user` *does* have reviews!

  1.  Do you remember when you assigned the first user in your database to `my_first_user`?

      ```ruby
      my_first_user = User.first
      ```

      It's been a while - it was the first thing you did when you entered the `rails console`.

      `my_first_user` is a variable, and it only knows about the data that existed when it was defined. Even though your first user now has a review in the database, the variable `my_first_user` doesn't know anything about it.

  1.  To update `my_first_user` with the new review data, run:

      ```ruby
      my_first_user.reload
      ```

  1.  Now, try running `my_first_user.reviews`.

      🎉

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Let's take a closer look at that new review.

  1.  Run the following code to assign the new review to a variable called `my_last_review`:

      ```ruby
      my_last_review = Review.last
      ```

  1.  `my_last_review` should have a `user_id`. Try running `my_last_review.user_id`.

      This will return the `user_id` of the user who's associated to `my_last_review`. Since we set it to `my_first_user`'s id, it will most likely be 1.

  1.  Now, let's try to get the user from the review. Try running `my_last_review.user`.

  1.  Hmm...that's an interesting error. Any thoughts on why you got a `NoMethodError`.

      (The hint is in the error)

      You got a `NoMethodError` because we haven't completely defined the relationship between users and reviews. You defined part of the relationship - a user has many reviews. However, you haven't defined the relationship between reviews and users.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> my_last_review = Review.last
    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "reviews".* FROM "reviews" ORDER BY "reviews"."id" DESC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  => #<Review id: 8, body: "This review was written by a user!", created_at: "2017-01-25 00:46:42", updated_at: "2017-01-25 00:48:55", book_id: 1, user_id: 1>

  >> my_last_review.user_id
  => 1

  >> my_last_review.user
  NoMethodError: undefined method `user' for #<Review:0x007fce9e4a5b90>
  Did you mean?  user_id
  ...
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  We need to define the relationship between reviews and users - a review belongs to a user.

  1.  Open `app/models/reviews.rb`. You might notice another relationship we already defined 😉

      Since a review also belongs to a book, you previously added this line:

      ```ruby
      belongs_to :book
      ```

      Now, we need to do the same thing for users.

  1.  Update `Review` so a review `belongs_to` a user.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class Review < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :book
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  That probably sounded more challenging than it was 😅

  1.  You should've added this line

      ```ruby
      belongs_to :user
      ```

  1.  If you didn't already, add this line to `Review` and save your changes.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class Review < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :book
    belongs_to :user
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Now, let's see if we can't get your last review's user.

  1.  Go back to the `rails console` and run the following line to pull in your changes.

      ```ruby
      reload!
      ```

  1.  Get your last review again and assign it to `my_last_review`.

  1.  Now, try running `my_last_review.user`.

  1.  Yayay!!!

      ![YES!]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/yes_triumph.gif)

  1.  Exit the `rails console`.

{% aside %}
  Now that we have a way to assign reviews to their users, let's update your bookstore so we always know who's leaving reviews.
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Remember, we can assign a review to a user by setting the `user_id` on the review. But do you remember how users create reviews?

      Users create reviews by submitting forms to the `ReviewsController` `create` method. Let's take a look at it.

  1.  In your text editor, open the `ReviewsController` (`app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb`) and find the `create` method.

      ```ruby
      def create
        book = Book.find(params[:book_id])
        book.reviews.create(review_params)
        redirect_to book_path(book)
      end
      ```
  1.  It's been a while since you added this method, so let's do a quick review.

      In the `create` method, you start by finding the book that's being reviewed.

      ```ruby
      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])
      ```

      Then, you create a new review for it using `review_params`.

      ```ruby
      book.reviews.create(review_params)
      ```

      `review_params` is a method that defines which of the form's fields can be set on the new review.

      ```ruby
      def review_params
        params.require(:review).permit(:body)
      end
      ```

      Using strong parameters, you set up the `review_params` method so the form must submit a `review` hash. The only field you're permitting in that hash is the `body` field.

  1.  Now, we need to update `review_params` so we can also set `user_id`.

      *But how do we know what the `user_id` should be?*

      Only logged in users can create new reviews, and we know which user is logged in because their user id is saved in the session as `user_id`.

      We'll have to change the `review_params` method so it lets us set `user_id` to the `user_id` saved in the session...
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class ReviewsController < ApplicationController
    before_action :verify_user_session

    def new
      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])
      @review = @book.reviews.build
    end

    def create
      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])
      book.reviews.create(review_params)
      redirect_to book_path(book)
    end

    def review_params
      params.require(:review).permit(:body)
    end

    def verify_user_session
      if session[:user_id].blank?
        flash[:alert] = "Please login to continue"
        redirect_to new_session_path
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Change the `review_params` method from

      ```ruby
      def review_params
        params.require(:review).permit(:body)
      end
      ```

      to

      ```ruby
      def review_params
        permitted_params = params.require(:review).permit(:body)
        permitted_params.merge(user_id: session[:user_id])
      end
      ```

      We're still using strong parameters to restrict which form fields can get set on a new review, but we'll assign them to a new variable called `permitted_params`.

      Then, we'll use the `merge` method to add `user_id` to `permitted_params`.

      `user_id` will be set to `session[:user_id]`.

  1.  Save your changes and start your application's web server.

  1.  Now, login and write a new book review!
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  class ReviewsController < ApplicationController
    before_action :verify_user_session

    def new
      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])
      @review = @book.reviews.build
    end

    def create
      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])
      book.reviews.create(review_params)
      redirect_to book_path(book)
    end

    def review_params
      permitted_params = params.require(:review).permit(:body)
      permitted_params.merge(user_id: session[:user_id])
    end

    def verify_user_session
      if session[:user_id].blank?
        flash[:alert] = "Please login to continue"
        redirect_to new_session_path
      end
    end
  end

  1.  Did you write a really inspiring review?? 😉

      Let's take a look at it on the `rails console`.

  1.  Stop your application's web server and start the `rails console`.

  1.  Now, get your last review and assign it to a variable called `my_last_review`.

  1.  Let's see who write your last review...

      Run `my_last_review.user`.

      Yay! I hope "CatPower" left a good review 😝

  1.  Exit the `rails console` and restart your application's web server.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight ruby %}
  >> my_last_review = Review.last
    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "reviews".* FROM "reviews" ORDER BY "reviews"."id" DESC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]

  >> exit
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% aside %}
  Now that we know who's leaving reviews, let's share that information with your bookstore's visitors.
{% endaside %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
  1.  Do you remember where reviews are shown?

      In your text editor, open `app/views/books/show.html.erb`.

  1.  Towards the end of the template, you're showing all of a books reviews in an unordered list. Let's include review usernames in the unordered list.

      Change the reviews unordered list from

      ```erb
      <ul>
        <% @book.reviews.each do |review| %>
          <li> <%= review.body %> </li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
      ```

      to

      ```erb
      <ul>
        <% @book.reviews.each do |review| %>
          <% if(review.user.present?) %>
            <li> <%= review.user.username %> - <%= review.body %> </li>
          <% else %>
            <li> Anonymous - <%= review.body %> </li>
          <% end %>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
      ```

      We'll show the usernames for reviews who have users. However, you probably have some older reviews in your database that don't have users. When that happens, we'll show "Anonymous" instead.

  1.  Save your changes and visit a book with reviews. You should see a mix of anonymous and not so anonymous users that have left behind some reviews 😊

  1.  Try adding new reviews. If you're still logged in as "CatPower", she'll start getting a lot of reviews in her name...

  1.  When you're done, stop your application's web server.
