        "content": "Getting Started from ScratchThroughout the tutorial, you’re going to run a lot of commands on the command line. For example, we might ask you to do something like  Run pwd to print your current working directory.Where you run these commands will vary depending on the type of computer you’re using.      If you’re using a Mac, you’ll type the command into Terminal.        If you’re on Windows, you’ll type the command into Command Prompt.  After you’ve typed the command, you’ll press enter to execute it.To keep things simple, we’ll refer to both Terminal and Command Prompt as Terminal in the tutorial.Windows users! If you followed our install instructions, you’ll have to run C:\\RubyDevKit\\devkitvars.bat when you open the Command Prompt.      Get started by opening Terminal.        You’re now in your home directory. Let’s take a look what you have in there.    Run ls to list everything inside your home directory.    ls        You might see some familiar directories like Desktop, Documents, and Music.        All code deserves a good home. Add a new Projects directory to your home directory by running mkdir Projects.    mkdir Projects            Navigate into your new Projects directory by running cd Projects.    cd Projects        Now you’re ready to create a new Rails application!    $ ls  Desktop Document Music  $ mkdir Projects  $ cd ProjectsBefore you can continue with the tutorial, your computer needs to be configured with Rails. If you haven’t already, please refer to the install instructions to get everything set up and ready to go.      Run rails new bookstore to create a new Rails application named “bookstore”.    rails new bookstore            After rails new finishes, run cd bookstore to navigate into the newly created bookstore application.    cd bookstore        $ rails new bookstore        create        create  README.md        create  Rakefile        create  config.ru        create  .gitignore        create  Gemfile        create  app        ...        run bundle install  Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/...........

Installing rake 11.3.0  ...  $ cd bookstoreWoah! The rails new command does a lot of stuff!When you run rails new, it creates the files and directories that make up the basic structure of your new Rails application. Then, it runs bundle install to install the dependencies needed to run the application.Let’s take a look the files that got created when you ran rails new.      Run ls -l to list out all the top level files and directories in the bookstore directory.    ls -l        There’s a lot of stuff in there, but a few things stand out.        Any code that is specific to your bookstore application will live in the app directory. This is where you’ll be doing most of your work for this tutorial.    Run ls -l app and take a look at some of things in there.    ls -l app        $ ls -l  total 48  -rw-r--r--   1 awesomesauce  staff  1728 Nov  6 14:31 Gemfile  -rw-r--r--   1 awesomesauce  staff  4329 Nov  6 14:33 Gemfile.lock  -rw-r--r--   1 awesomesauce  staff   374 Nov  6 14:13 README.md  -rw-r--r--   1 awesomesauce  staff   227 Nov  6 14:13 Rakefile  drwxr-xr-x  10 awesomesauce  staff   340 Nov  6 14:13 app  drwxr-xr-x   7 awesomesauce  staff   238 Nov  6 14:13 bin  drwxr-xr-x  14 awesomesauce  staff   476 Nov 12 18:56 config  -rw-r--r--   1 awesomesauce  staff   130 Nov  6 14:13 config.ru  drwxr-xr-x   4 awesomesauce  staff   136 Nov 12 18:54 db  drwxr-xr-x   4 awesomesauce  staff   136 Nov  6 14:13 lib  drwxr-xr-x   4 awesomesauce  staff   136 Nov  6 14:34 log  drwxr-xr-x   9 awesomesauce  staff   306 Nov  6 14:13 public  drwxr-xr-x   9 awesomesauce  staff   306 Nov  6 14:13 test  drwxr-xr-x   7 awesomesauce  staff   238 Nov  6 14:34 tmp  drwxr-xr-x   3 awesomesauce  staff   102 Nov  6 14:13 vendor  $ ls -l app  total 0  drwxr-xr-x  6 awesomesauce  staff  204 Nov  6 14:13 assets  drwxr-xr-x  3 awesomesauce  staff  102 Nov  6 14:13 channels  drwxr-xr-x  4 awesomesauce  staff  136 Nov  6 14:13 controllers  drwxr-xr-x  3 awesomesauce  staff  102 Nov  6 14:13 helpers  drwxr-xr-x  3 awesomesauce  staff  102 Nov  6 14:13 jobs  drwxr-xr-x  3 awesomesauce  staff  102 Nov  6 14:13 mailers  drwxr-xr-x  4 awesomesauce  staff  136 Nov  6 14:13 models  drwxr-xr-x  3 awesomesauce  staff  102 Nov  6 14:13 viewsIt’s easiest to view and edit the files of your application using a text editor created just for programming. If you don’t already have a favorite text editor we recommend Atom.The config directory is where you’ll store configuration files for the bookstore application.rails new generated a bunch of configuration files to help you get this new application up and running quickly. Let’s take a look at one of those files.      Using your favorite text editor, open the whole bookstore directory.    If you’re using Atom, you can do this by going to File &gt; Open....        Now, open config/database.yml.    database.yml tells Rails how to connect to the bookstore application’s database.    By default, the bookstore application is setup to use SQLite. It’s a light weight database that’s perfect for this tutorial.    Since we’re happy with the default database.yml generated by rails new, we can live it as is.  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425  # SQLite version 3.x  #   gem install sqlite3  #  #   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile  #   gem 'sqlite3'  #  default: &amp;default    adapter: sqlite3    pool: 5    timeout: 5000  development:    &lt;&lt;: *default    database: db/development.sqlite3  # Warning: The database defined as \"test\" will be erased and  # re-generated from your development database when you run \"rake\".  # Do not set this db to the same as development or production.  test:    &lt;&lt;: *default    database: db/test.sqlite3  production:    &lt;&lt;: *default    database: db/production.sqlite3Not sure what a database is? Don’t worry, we’ll fill you in. 😊There are many different types of databases out there, but we’ll only be working with a relational database.A relational database is made up of tables where you store data. You can think of them kinda like an Excel spreadsheet but much more powerful. There are many types of Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS’s for short) and SQLite is just one of them.Feel free to check out this video to learn a bit more about Relational Databases:While you’re working through the tutorial, don’t worry if what you’re seeing doesn’t look exactly like the examples in the tutorial. Everyone’s setup is going to be a little different, and small things can change between different versions of Rails.Let’s get the application running!      Go back to Terminal and make sure you’re in the bookstore directory by running pwd.    pwd        pwd shows you what directory you’re in. You should see something like /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore.        If you’re not in the bookstore directory, you’re probably in your home directory.    To get to the bookstore directory from your home directory, first run cd Projects to get to your Projects directory. Then, run cd bookstore.    cd Projectscd bookstore            Now run rails server to start your application’s web server.    If you take a close look at the command’s output, you’ll see where you can access the running application:    =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development onhttp://localhost:3000            Open you web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000  =&gt; Run `rails server -h` for more startup options  Puma starting in single mode...  * Version 3.6.0 (ruby 2.3.1-p112), codename: Sleepy Sunday Serenity  * Min threads: 5, max threads: 5  * Environment: development  * Listening on tcp://localhost:3000  Use Ctrl-C to stopYay! The bookstore application is running!      Go back to Terminal and take a look at what’s happening in your application’s web server. You can see the application responding to requests!        Now that you’re back in Terminal, run Ctrl-C to stop your application’s web server.    $ rails server  ...

        "content": "Creating the First Table in Your Database      Open Terminal.        If you still have Terminal open from the previous chapter, you should be in the bookstore directory.    Do you remember how to check what directory you’re in?    (pwd)        If you’re not already in the bookstore directory, run the following commands to get there:    cd Projectscd bookstore            Now run    rails generate model book        This generated a few new files, but there are only a couple we’re interesed in.        Run ls -l db/migrate to take a look at one of the new files. You should see a file named something like 20161115030350_create_books.rb.    20161115030350 is a timestamp generated when the file is created. Your file will start with a more recent timestamp…I hope 😝    Let’s take a look at this file in your text editor.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rails generate model book        invoke  active_record        create    db/migrate/20161115030350_create_books.rb        create    app/models/book.rb        invoke    test_unit        create      test/models/book_test.rb        create      test/fixtures/books.yml  $ ls -l db/migrate  total 8  -rw-r--r--  1 awesomesauce  staff  131 Nov 14 22:03 20161115030350_create_books.rb      Open db/migrate/YOUR_TIMESTAMP_create_books.rb in your text editor.    This is a migration file called CreateBooks. Migrations are used to make changes to your database.    On line 3 of the CreateBooks migration, there’s a block called create_table. Inside this block, you’ll make changes to add columns to the new books table.  12345678  class CreateBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :books do |t|        t.timestamps      end    end  endYou might remember blocks from the Ruby in 100 Minutes tutorial.Like most blocks, the create_table block starts with the do keyword and ends with the end keyword.The books table will need a few columns.It will need a string column to store book titles and another string column to store book authors.The table will also need a column to store book prices. Since keeping track of money can be tricky, the column will need to be an integer column where book prices can be stored in cents. It sounds weird, but you’ll have to trust me on this one.      Inside the create_table block, add the following lines:    t.string :titlet.string :authort.integer :price_cents            Save your changes to the CreateBooks migration and go back to Terminal.  12345678910  class CreateBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :books do |t|        t.string :title        t.string :author        t.integer :price_cents        t.timestamps      end    end  endWhat’s t.timestamps?You added a few things to the create_table block, but you might’ve noticed that there was already some code in there:create_table :books do |t|  t.timestampsendWhat’s t.timestamps?It’s a convinence method added by Rails that will add two more columns to the books table: created_at and updated_at. They’ll be used to store the times when books are created and updated.      In Terminal, make sure you’re in the bookstore directory.        Run rake db:migrate.        Yay! You’ve just run your first migration!    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rake db:migrate  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrating ======================================  -- create_table(:books)     -&gt; 0.0030s  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrated (0.0034s) =============================What just happened?This migration just added a table to your database!One of the advantages of using a framework like Rails is that you can build and modify a database without having to use raw SQL.The migration was just one of the files that was generated by rails generate model book. It also generated another file: app/models/book.rb. Let’s take a quick look at it.      Open app/models/book.rb in your text editor.    It might not look very exciting, but it’s actually pretty powerful. We now have a Book class. The Book class is used to represent individual rows in the books table.    Still not impressed? Let’s see what you can do with this class.  12  class Book &lt; ApplicationRecord  endYou might remember classes from the Ruby in 100 minutes tutorial.Classes are used to describe things. For example, the Book class in your bookstore is used to describe books.      Open Terminal and make sure you’re in the bookstore directory.        Run rails console. This will open…the rails console.    The rails console is available in all Rails applications. It let’s you play around with the different things in your applications including the data stored in your database.    Now that you’re in the rails console, let’s see what we can do with the Book class.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt;      Let’s try creating my favorite book.    In the rails console, run the following code:    my_favorite_book = Book.new        This assigns a new instance of Book to a variable so that we can refer to it as my_favorite_book.        Now, to give this new instance of book a title run:    my_favorite_book.title = \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"            my_favorite_book now has a title.    Don’t believe me?! Try running my_favorite_book.title. It should return “why’s (poignant) Guide to Ruby”.    &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book = Book.new  =&gt; #&lt;Book id: nil, title: nil, author: nil, price_cents: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.title = \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"  =&gt; \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.title  =&gt; \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"Remember those other columns we added to the books table? We can set those on my_favorite_book.      Try setting my_favorite_book’s author to “why the lucky stiff”.        Although my_favorite_book is priceless, you can go ahead and give it a price. Remember, we named this column price_cents.        We should probably keep track of the number of copies we have of my favorite book. Run the following code to set the quantity:    my_favorite_book.quantity = 500        Did that work? No?!    Welcome to your first error!        These errors can seem intimidating at first, but they can be suprisingly helpful as you work your way through building an application.    So let’s embrace and explore these errors together!    &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.author = \"why the lucky stiff\"  =&gt; \"why the lucky stiff\"  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.price_cents = 100  =&gt; 100  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.quantity = 500  NoMethodError: undefined method `quantity=' for #&lt;Book:0x007fdc9453bf60&gt;      from /Users/awesomesauce/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.1/gems/activemodel-5.0.0.1/lib/active_model/attribute_methods.rb:433:in `method_missing'      from (irb):11      from /Users/awesomesauce/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.1/gems/railties-5.0.0.1/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:65:in `start'      from /Users/awesomesauce/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.1/gems/railties-5.0.0.1/lib/rails/commands/console_helper.rb:9:in `start'      from /Users/awesomesauce/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.1/gems/railties-5.0.0.1/lib/rails/commands/commands_tasks.rb:78:in `console'      from /Users/awesomesauce/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.1/gems/railties-5.0.0.1/lib/rails/commands/commands_tasks.rb:49:in `run_command!'      from /Users/awesomesauce/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.1/gems/railties-5.0.0.1/lib/rails/commands.rb:18:in `&lt;top (required)&gt;'      from bin/rails:4:in `require'      from bin/rails:4:in `&lt;main&gt;'Your first errorWe tried setting quantity on my_favorite_book, but we got an error:&gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.quantity = 500NoMethodError: undefined method `quantity=' for #&lt;Book:0x007fdc9453bf60&gt;We get a NoMethodError for quantity= because quantity isn’t a attribute we can set on Book.If you remember the CreateBooks migration, we added a few columns, but we never added a column for quantity.class CreateBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]  def change    create_table :books do |t|      t.string :title      t.string :author      t.integer :price_cents      t.timestamps    end  endendYour database is currently in a bad state. The books table needs a quantity column to store the number of available books.Fortunately, we have a few ways to fix this.Migrations are designed to run in two directions. So far, we’ve run the CreateBooks migration “up” to add the books table.Now, we’re going to run the CreateBooks migration “down”. By running the migration “down”, the books table will be removed. With the table no longer in the database, we can make changes to the migration and re-run it so the books table has the quantity column.      First, exit the rails console by running exit.        Then, run the CreateBooks migration down by running rake db:rollback.    &gt;&gt; exit  $ rake db:rollback  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: reverting ======================================  -- drop_table(:books)     -&gt; 0.0098s  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: reverted (0.0143s) =============================      Go back to your text editor and open the CreateBooks migration.        Inside the create_table block, add the following line:    t.integer :quantity            Save your changes to the CreateBooks migration.  1234567891011  class CreateBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :books do |t|        t.string :title        t.string :author        t.integer :price_cents        t.timestamps        t.integer :quantity      end    end  end      Go back to Terminal.        Re-run the migration by running rake db:migrate.    $ rake db:migrate  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrating ======================================  -- create_table(:books)     -&gt; 0.0415s  == 20161115030350 CreateBooks: migrated (0.0416s) =============================Now that your books table has the quantity column, you can go back to adding my favorite book 😉      Enter the rails console by running…rails console.        You already forgot what my favorite book was, didn’t you?    No worries. You can run each of the following lines of code in your console to refresh your memory:    my_favorite_book = Book.newmy_favorite_book.title = \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"my_favorite_book.author = \"why the lucky stiff\"my_favorite_book.price_cents = 100            Ok, now that you have my favorite book again try adding the quantity:    my_favorite_book.quantity = 500            Alright, my favorite book is coming along nicely. I think we’re ready to save it to your database.    Run my_favorite_book.save to save my favorite book to your database.    If the last thing you see says true, my favorite books has been saved to your database. Yay!    &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book = Book.new  =&gt; #&lt;Book id: nil, title: nil, author: nil, price_cents: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, quantity: nil&gt;  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.title = \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"  =&gt; \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\"  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.author = \"why the lucky stiff\"  =&gt; \"why the lucky stiff\"  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.price_cents = 100  =&gt; 100  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.quantity = 500  =&gt; 500  &gt;&gt; my_favorite_book.save     (0.1ms)  begin transaction    SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO \"books\" (\"title\", \"author\", \"price_cents\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"quantity\") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

Let’s try using the create method to add my second favorite book to your database.    Run the following code on the rails console:    Book.create(title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", author: \"Dr. Seuss\", price_cents: 500, quantity: 200)        The create method lets us save data in a single command. Instead of setitng attributes one at a time, we can set them all at once.    &gt;&gt; Book.create(title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", author: \"Dr. Seuss\", price_cents: 500, quantity: 200)     (0.1ms)  begin transaction    SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO \"books\" (\"title\", \"author\", \"price_cents\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"quantity\") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [[\"title\", \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\"], [\"author\", \"Dr. Seuss\"], [\"price_cents\", 500], [\"created_at\", 2016-11-24 03:33:22 UTC], [\"updated_at\", 2016-11-24 03:33:22 UTC], [\"quantity\", 200]]     (3.7ms)  commit transaction  =&gt; #&lt;Book id: 2, title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", author: \"Dr. Seuss\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", quantity: 200&gt;Now that we’ve added some books to your database, let’s try pulling them out of the database.      My second favorite book was the last book you added to your database. To get it, run Book.last on the rails console.        My favorite book was the first book you added. Can you guess how we would get it?    Run Book.first to get the first book in your database.        What if you wanted to see all the books in your database? How would you do that??    Run Book.all to get all the books in your database.    Programming can be really confusing, but every once in a while it kinda makes sense 😊    &gt;&gt; Book.last    Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"books\".* FROM \"books\" ORDER BY \"books\".\"id\" DESC LIMIT ?

Add five more books to your bookstore.        When you’re done, run Book.count to get the total number of books in your database. It should return 7.        After you’ve added five more books and verified that they are saved to your database, exit the rails console by running exit.  ",

You are building a web application after all. 😉      Before you can see your books, you’ll need make some changes. Open the bookstore directory in your text editor.        Now open config/routes.rb and add the following line inside the only block in the file:    resources :books            Save your changes.  1234    Rails.application.routes.draw do      # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html      resources :books    end      Go back to Terminal and make sure you’re in the bookstore directory.

Since you added books as a resource in config/routes.rb, your application now has a bunch of book routes.    The URI Pattern column in the table tells you how to reach the routes from a browser.    For example, when your application is running locally you can reach /books by going to http://localhost:3000/books.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rake routes     Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action      books GET    /books(.:format)          books#index            POST   /books(.:format)          books#create   new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)      books#new  edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format) books#edit       book GET    /books/:id(.:format)      books#show            PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            PUT    /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            DELETE /books/:id(.:format)      books#destroyLet’s trying going to the /books route.

See, it’s empty 😝    touch creates empty files. You used it to create an empty file called app/controllers/books_controller.rb.  The error you got said something about there being a missing constant BooksController. Let’s add it.      Add the following code to app/controllers/books_controller.rb:    class BooksController &lt; ApplicationControllerend        That should define the constant Rails was looking for.        Save the file and try going to http://localhost:3000/books again.    New error!  12class BooksController &lt; ApplicationControllerendThis new error is telling us that your BooksController doesn’t have an index action. That kinda makes sense - we didn’t add very much code to the BooksController. But why does it care that the index action is missing?Remember the routing table? Kinda? Don’t worry, it’s fuzzy for me too. Let’s pull it up again.      Go back to Terminal and stop the rails server by running Ctrl-c.        Now, run rake routes. Voila - the routing table.    The first entry in the routing table is for the /books path.

The URI Pattern /books(.:format) maps to the Controller#Action pair of books#index. This tells us requests to the /books path will be routed to the BooksController index action.    Clear as mud, right? Don’t worry, it’ll make more sense later.        Now that we (kinda) know why we’re trying to run the index action, let’s add it.

In this case, Rails is expecting your application to have an index template to go with the BooksController index action.Let’s make that happen!      Stop your rails server by running Ctrl-c.        All templates live in the app/views directory.    app/views will have directories for each of the controllers in your application. By default, a controller’s template directory will be the name of the controller…minus the controller.    For example, the templates for the BooksController will live in the app/views/books directory.    Create the BooksController template directory by running mkdir app/views/books.        Now, create the template for the BooksController’s index action by running touch app/views/books/index.html.erb.        Restart your web server.    (Remember? Start your web server by running rails server.)        Now, try going to http://localhost:3000/books.

Yay! 🎉  1  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;Listing All the ThingsYou’ve been going to the /books path a bunch and as a result you’ve been running the BooksController index action a lot.You can think of an index action in a Rails application as the index of a book. It’s used to list all of a controller’s resources.Since we’re dealing with the BooksController, this index action is going to list all of your bookstore’s books.Before you can show all of your books in the browser, you have to make the books data available through your application’s BooksController index action.      In your text editor, open app/controllers/books_controller.rb. Inside the index method, add the following line:    @books = Book.all        That line might look a little familiar. In Chapter 2, we used Book.all to list all your books on the rails console.    We’re using the same method again so we can render your books in the browser.        Save your changes.  12345  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end  endBy making that change to the BooksController index action, you’ve made book data available to your index template.Let’s see what you can do with it.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/index.html.erb and add the following line to the end of the file:    &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;            Save your changes and try going to http://localhost:3000/books again.  12  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;Your application’s data might be a little different than mine, but you’re probably seeing the title to MY favorite book. Yippie!(If your data is different, you’re seeing the title of some other book…sigh 😉)You had to do a couple of things to get that title to show up in your browser.First in the BooksController index method, you defined an instance variable @books and assigned it all the books in your application.class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController  def index    @books = Book.all  endendThen in the associated index template (app/views/books/index.html.erb), you used some funny looking syntax to get the first book and show it’s title.&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;Let’s focus on that funny looking syntax for a few minutes.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/index.html.erb.        Remember that line you added to the end of the file?    &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;        Change it so it looks like this:    &lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;            Can you guess what this will change? Reload http://localhost:3000/books to see what happens.  12  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;You’re seeing a different book title, aren’t you?You used @books[0] to get the first book from your database, and you changed it to @books[1] to get the next book.I bet you could get all the books to render on the index template…      Spend some time and see if you can get all the book titles to render. If you’ve been following along with the tutorial, you should have seven books in your application.    If you know some HTML, try listing the titles in an unordered list.    Don’t know very much HTML? Don’t worry about it - you’ll get familiar with it reaaaal soon. Just focus on getting the titles to render.        What did you come up with?    One way may have been to list out each book like this:    &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;%= @books[3].title %&gt;&lt;%= @books[4].title %&gt;&lt;%= @books[5].title %&gt;&lt;%= @books[6].title %&gt;        That renders all the book titles, but they end up getting rendered on a single line.        If you know some HTML, you may have thrown in a few brs to give the titles some space like this:    &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;%= @books[3].title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;%= @books[4].title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;%= @books[5].title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;%= @books[6].title %&gt;            Better yet, you may have even used an unordered list:    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[3].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[4].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[5].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[6].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;            If you used an unordered list, great!    If not, no worries - update your solution to use an unordered list.  1234567891011  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[3].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[4].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[5].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[6].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;Yay! Book titles!But doesn’t a lot of that code in your template look just a little…repetitive?&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;...There has to be a better way!?There is! 😄Remember when you defined @books in the BooksController index method?@books = Book.allYou defined @books to be a collection of all the books in your application’s database. For our purposes, we can treat this collection like a Ruby Array.You can get each item of a Ruby array by its index, and the first item starts at index 0.Does that sound familiar? It’s what you used to render the book titles.  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  ...This works well, but it’s a very manual process. You have to individually access each book to render its title. It also depends on you knowing how many books there are in the database.In Ruby, we don’t have to access each book individually like this. We can use Array’s each method to help us out.Let’s see what that would look like.You might remember reading about arrays in the Ruby in 100 minutes tutorial. Arrays are most commonly used for storing a list or collection of things.      Go back to your terminal and quit the rails server by running Ctrl-c.        Now, start the rails console by running…rails console.        Run the following code:    books = Book.all        You now have a books variable that’s been assigned all the books in your application’s database. books can be thought of as a Ruby Array.    Sound familiar 😉        Now, try running the following:    books.each { |book| puts book.title }        What happened?    You used the each method to iterate over each book and print its title.        The curly braces ({}) after each are the start and end of a block. We’ve seen the other block notation before - it starts with a do and ends with an end.    Try running the following:    books.each do |book|  puts book.titleend        The syntax might be different, but it’s the same result - each of the book titles are printed.        At the beginning of the block, you have a couple of pipes surronding book    books.each { |book| ... }        This is called a block parameter. In this case, it lets you access each book so you can print its title.    Before, we would’ve manually gone through each book to print its title.    puts books[0].titleputs books[1].title...        Now, each lets us do it in a lot less code.    books.each { |book| puts book.title }            Try playing with the each method to see what else you can print out. You should be able print things like the book ids, authors, and quantities.        When you’re done exploring, run exit to exit the rails console. Then, restart the rails server.    &gt;&gt; books = Book.all    Book Load (1.4ms)  SELECT \"books\".* FROM \"books\"  =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation [#&lt;Book id: 1, title: \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\", author: \"why the lucky stiff\", price_cents: 100, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:30:53\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:30:53\", quantity: 500&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 2, title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", author: \"Dr. Seuss\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", quantity: 200&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 4, title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", price_cents: 0, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:35:44\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:35:44\", quantity: 200&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 5, title: \"The Sound and The Fury\", author: \"William Faulkner\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:36:47\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:36:47\", quantity: 150&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 6, title: \"Life of Pi\", author: \"Yann Martel\", price_cents: 750, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:37:40\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:37:40\", quantity: 50&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 7, title: \"The Kite Runner\", author: \"Khaled Hosseini\", price_cents: 600, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:38:28\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:38:28\", quantity: 23&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 8, title: \"Ender's Game\", author: \"Orson Scott Card\", price_cents: 42, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:40:20\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:40:20\", quantity: 1000&gt;]&gt;  &gt;&gt; books.each { |book| puts book.title }  why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby  Oh, the Places You'll Go!  1984  The Sound and The Fury  Life of Pi  The Kite Runner  Ender's Game  =&gt; [#&lt;Book id: 1, title: \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\", author: \"why the lucky stiff\", price_cents: 100, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:30:53\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:30:53\", quantity: 500&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 2, title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", author: \"Dr. Seuss\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", quantity: 200&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 4, title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", price_cents: 0, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:35:44\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:35:44\", quantity: 200&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 5, title: \"The Sound and The Fury\", author: \"William Faulkner\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:36:47\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:36:47\", quantity: 150&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 6, title: \"Life of Pi\", author: \"Yann Martel\", price_cents: 750, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:37:40\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:37:40\", quantity: 50&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 7, title: \"The Kite Runner\", author: \"Khaled Hosseini\", price_cents: 600, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:38:28\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:38:28\", quantity: 23&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 8, title: \"Ender's Game\", author: \"Orson Scott Card\", price_cents: 42, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:40:20\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:40:20\", quantity: 1000&gt;]  &gt;&gt; books.each do |book|  ?&gt;     puts book.title  &gt;&gt;   end  why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby  Oh, the Places You'll Go!  1984  The Sound and The Fury  Life of Pi  The Kite Runner  Ender's Game  =&gt; [#&lt;Book id: 1, title: \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\", author: \"why the lucky stiff\", price_cents: 100, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:30:53\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:30:53\", quantity: 500&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 2, title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", author: \"Dr. Seuss\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", updated_at: \"2016-11-24 03:33:22\", quantity: 200&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 4, title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", price_cents: 0, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:35:44\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:35:44\", quantity: 200&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 5, title: \"The Sound and The Fury\", author: \"William Faulkner\", price_cents: 500, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:36:47\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:36:47\", quantity: 150&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 6, title: \"Life of Pi\", author: \"Yann Martel\", price_cents: 750, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:37:40\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:37:40\", quantity: 50&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 7, title: \"The Kite Runner\", author: \"Khaled Hosseini\", price_cents: 600, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:38:28\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:38:28\", quantity: 23&gt;, #&lt;Book id: 8, title: \"Ender's Game\", author: \"Orson Scott Card\", price_cents: 42, created_at: \"2016-11-30 01:40:20\", updated_at: \"2016-11-30 01:40:20\", quantity: 1000&gt;]Let’s put this new knowledge to work.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/index.html.erb.        At the end of the file, add a new, empty unordered list. It should look like this:    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        Inside the new unordered list, we’ll want to iterate over all the books assigned to @books and render a list item for each book title.    We can iterate over @books by using the each method.    You’ve used the each method on the rails console, but how will you use it in your template?        To run Ruby code in your template, you have to put it inside some funny looking brackets:    &lt;% ... %&gt;        Everything inside &lt;% %&gt; will get run in your template.    We’ve seen something similar before. Remember how you got the book titles to render?    &lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;        The syntax is slightly different. &lt;%= %&gt; runs Ruby code and renders the result in your template.    &lt;% %&gt; on the other hand only runs Ruby code. It does not render theresult of that code.    With that in mind, add the following code inside your new unordered list:    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books. Did anything change?    Nothing changed! You’re running @books.each in your template, but since it’s inside &lt;% %&gt; the result of that block isn’t rendered.  12345678910111213141516  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[3].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[4].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[5].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[6].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;You can use that funny looking syntax in your templates because they’re ERB templates.ERB templates are available in all Rails applications. Any file that ends in .html.erb is an ERB template.Now that you have your block set up, you’re ready to render some book titles.      Spend a few minutes and try to get each book title to render as a list item inside the block.    Remember, inside the block each book is availble to you as book.    When you’re done, you should see two identical unordered lists on http://localhost:3000/books.        Did you get it?! Your new unordered list should look something like this:    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= book.title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        Update your solution to match this solution.        Compare your two unordered lists. They both end in the same result, but one required a little more effort.    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[0].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[1].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[2].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[3].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[4].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[5].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @books[6].title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= book.title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        We can take advantage of the ability to run Ruby code inside Rails templates to do things quickly.        You don’t need to show both unordered lists, so go ahead and remove the first one.  1234567  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= book.title %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;Now that you have book titles rendering, let’s try adding some information.      Update the books unordered lists so it includes the book author next to each author like this:    why’s (poignant) Guide to Ruby by why the lucky stiff        What did you come up with? Compare your solution with people around you.    Inside the @books.each block, you should’ve edited the list item so it renders each book’s author next to its title.    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= book.title %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;            Update your solution to match this solution.        When you’re done, stop your application’s web server by running Ctrl-C.  1234567  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= book.title %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;",

        "content": "Showing Detailed Information in the BrowserYour bookstore is starting to come along. You have an index that lists all the books in your database by title and author. This is great, but what about the other information you’ve stored about your books? It would be useful to see how much a book costs, or how many are available.Let’s show this information.Let’s start by looking at your application’s routes again.      Open Terminal and go to your bookstore directory.        Run rake routes.    So far we’ve worked with the first row in the routes table. We used the /books path with the BooksController index action to list all your application’s books.    books GET    /books(.:format)          books#index        Now that we want to show detailed book information we’ll need to use a different route.    book GET    /books/:id(.:format)      books#show        This time, we’ll use the /books/:id path with the BooksController show action to show a book’s information.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rake routes     Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action      books GET    /books(.:format)          books#index            POST   /books(.:format)          books#create   new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)      books#new  edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format) books#edit       book GET    /books/:id(.:format)      books#show            PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            PUT    /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            DELETE /books/:id(.:format)      books#destroyIn the /books/:id path, we can take advantage of :id to get a book by it’s id.What’s that? You didn’t know a book could have an id? Let’s take a look.      Go back to Terminal and start rails console.        In the console, run Book.first to get the first book from your database.    Take a look at the output. It might be hard to see, but at the beginning there’s an id.    #&lt;Book id: 1, title: \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\", ... &gt;        The first book in your database has an id of 1.        I wonder what id your second book will have…    Run Book.second and look at the output.    #&lt;Book id: 2, title: \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", ... &gt;        The second book in your database has an id of … 2!!!    By default, every book you create will be given a unique id, and it will be given an id in sequential order.

Go back to Terminal and start your application’s web server by running rails server.        :id can be replaced with specific ids. Since we know your first book’s id is 1, we can go to /books/1.    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/books/1.        An unknown action error?! Why does that look familiar… 😉    You’re trying to access the BooksController show action, but it doesn’t exist. Let’s make it!    $ rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000  =&gt; Run `rails server -h` for more startup options  Puma starting in single mode...  * Version 3.6.0 (ruby 2.3.1-p112), codename: Sleepy Sunday Serenity  * Min threads: 5, max threads: 5  * Environment: development  * Listening on tcp://localhost:3000  Use Ctrl-C to stop  Started GET \"/books/1\" for ::1 at 2016-12-26 12:07:18 -0500    ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration Load (0.2ms)  SELECT \"schema_migrations\".* FROM \"schema_migrations\"  AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The action 'show' could not be found for BooksController):  ...

After the index action, add the following:    def showend            Save your changes, and go to http://localhost:3000/books/1 again.        Now you get a different error:    ActionController::UnknownFormat (BooksController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.        We’ve seen this error too.

Go back to Terminal and stop your application’s web server by running Ctrl-C.        Now, run touch app/views/books/show.html.erb to create the empty template.        Restart your application’s web server by running rails server and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1.    Remember, a blank page means no errors. 😆    Now that we have the BooksController show action rendering a template, we’re ready to show a book’s details.    $ rails server  ...  ^CExiting  $ touch app/views/books/show.html.erb  $ rails server  ...How do we know which book we’re showing?Before you can show a book’s details, you have to figure out which book’s details to show. How can we figure out which book to show?When you visit http://localhost:3000/books/1, you send a request to your application’s web server. Thanks to Rails routing, the book id (1) is included in that request.Started GET \"/books/1\" for ::1 at 2016-12-26 16:12:07 -0500Processing by BooksController#show as HTML  Parameters: {\"id\"=&gt;\"1\"}  Rendering books/show.html.erb within layouts/application  Rendered books/show.html.erb within layouts/application (0.3ms)Completed 200 OK in 266ms (Views: 263.1ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)It’s tucked in there, but the id is inside the parameters hash. See it? Try to find it in your server’s output.Parameters: {\"id\"=&gt;\"1\"}Let’s see how we can access the parameters hash in your BooksController show method.      Open your text editor and go to app/controllers/books_controller.rb.        Request parameters are available in all your application’s controllers as params.    Inside the show method, add the following code:    @id = params[:id]      123456789  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]    end  endBy defining @id in the BooksController show method, it’s available in the BooksController show template.      Open app/views/books/show.html.erb in your text editor and add the following:    This book's id is &lt;%= @id %&gt;.            Save your changes.  1  This book's id is &lt;%= @id %&gt;.Now that the BooksController show template is wired up to render something, what do you expect to see if you visit http://localhost:3000/books/1?Do you have an idea? Let’s verify it!      Go to http://localhost:3000/books/1.    What do you see?? Was it what you were expecting?  Did reality meet your expecations?The page renders “This book’s id is 1.” becuase you made a request from your browser with book id 1 (http://localhost:3000/books/1).You’re able to render the id because you grabbed it from the request parameters and assigned it to @id inside the BooksController show action.What happens if you go to http://localhost:3000/books/2?What about http://localhost:3000/books/3?The new book id is rendered on every request because you wired up the template to show the requested book’s id.Finding a BookNow that we have the book id for the book we want to show, we can use it to get that book from your application’s database.We’ve used a few methods to get books from the database. We’ve used Book.all to get all the books, and we’ve used Book.first to get the first book.But how do we get a book by it’s id? Let’s explore on the rails console.      Go back to Terminal and quit your application’s web server by running Ctrl-C. Then, start the rails console.        Now try running the following code:    Book.find(3)        What did it return? It returned the book in your application’s database with id 3.    #&lt;Book id: 3, title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", price_cents: 0, created_at: \"2016-12-26 15:51:15\", updated_at: \"2016-12-26 15:51:15\", quantity: 200&gt;            What do you get when you run Book.find(1) or Book.find(5)?    You get the book with that id.        What happens if you do Book.find(100)?    ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Book with 'id'=100        An error! Book.find returns an error when it doesn’t find a book with the given book id.    So we can use Book.find to get books from your application’s database with a given id. If a book doesn’t exist with that id, we get an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error.        Exit the console and restart your application’s web server.    $ rails server  ...  ^CExiting  $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; Book.find(3)    Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"books\".* FROM \"books\" WHERE \"books\".\"id\" = ?

In your text editor, open the BooksController.        We’ve already grabbed the requested book id and set it to @id. Let’s use that to find the requested book.    Add the following line to the end of the show method:    @book = Book.find(@id)            Save your changes and go to http://localhost:3000/books/1.    Did you notice anything different? I hope not, because we didn’t update the template 😝  12345678910  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end  end      Now, open the BooksController show template (app/views/books/show.html.erb).        Add the following line to the end of the file    This book is called &lt;%= @book.title %&gt;            Save your changes and go back to http://localhost:3000/books/1.  12  This book's id is &lt;%= @id %&gt;.  This book is called &lt;%= @book.title %&gt;.Yay! You got the request book and showed some of its information.Unfortunately, it’s kinda smashed together on the page.Let’s use a definition list to clean it up.      Open app/views/books/show.html.erb in your text editor and delete everything in the file.    Yes, EVERYTHING.    There’s nothing wrong with what we’ve done so far, but adding the definition list is easier from scratch.        Now, add the following code to the file:    &lt;dl&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;        This is an HTML definition list with a couple of terms: “Id” and “Title”. The terms are defined with values for the given book.    Save your changes and go to http://localhost:3000/books/1 to see the results.  1234567  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;      Now that we have a definition list with the book's id and title, update it to include the rest of the book's information (author, price_cents, and quantity).        What did you come up with? Your solution should look something like this:    &lt;dl&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Price Cents&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.price_cents %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;            Update your solution to match this solution.  12345678910111213141516  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price Cents&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.price_cents %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;Price Cents?The books details look great, but doesn’t “Price Cents” look kinda weird?Do you ever wonder how much something would cost in pennies? Really?! I thought I was the only one!For most people, it would be easier to see the book’s price in dollars. Fortunately, Rails has our back.Rails provides a number_to_currency method that prints a number as currency.Let’s see what happens when you use it.      Reopen app/views/books/show.html.erb and change the “Price Cents” definition from    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.price_cents %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;        to    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents) %&gt;            Save your changes and revist http://localhost:3000/books/1.  12345678910111213141516  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price Cents&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;Looks great, right?!Except why’s (poignant) Guide to Ruby doesn’t cost $100.00. We set the book’s price_cents to 100, and 100 cents is $1.00.number_to_currency formats a number as a dollar amount, but the number has to be in dollars.We need to first convert price_cents to dollars before we can really use number_to_currency.      Reopen app/views/books/show.html.erb and change the “Price Cents” definition from    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;        to    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents / 100.0) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;        To convert from cents to dollars, we can simply divide by 100.    (Actually we have to divide by 100.0 because floating point math is fun)    Then, the converted value is used by number_to_currency.        You can also go ahead and change the definition term from “Price Cents” to “Price”.        Save your changes and try looking up a few of your books in your browser.  12345678910111213141516  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents / 100.0) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;We’re making really good progress! Anyone can visit your bookstore to see what books you have, and they can learn a little about those books.I love that I can see what books you have and how much they cost, but what if I’ve never heard of one of your books before??Let’s add book descriptions to help give just a little more info about your books.Adding descriptions to booksWe can add descriptions to books by adding a description column to the books table.Do you remember how we added columns to your application’s database tables?We’ve done that through migrations. We created a migration to add the books table, and we changed that migration to add new columns.Now that you’re bookstore application is coming along, we don’t want to go back and edit past migrations. Editing past migrations can compromise the data you’ve worked so hard to collect!But how will we add the description column to the books table??A new migration!      Go back to Terminal and stop your application’s web server by running Ctrl-C.        Now, run rails generate migration add_description_to_books.    This creates a new timestamped migration file db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_add_description_to_books.rb.    $ rails generate migration add_description_to_books        invoke  active_record        create    db/migrate/20161227020938_add_description_to_books.rb      Open your new migration in your text editor.        Inside the change method, add the following line:    add_column :books, :description, :text        With this change, we’re setting up the migration to add a column to the books table. The new column will be named description and it will store any amount of text.        Save your changes.  12345  class AddDescriptionToBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      add_column :books, :description, :text    end  end      Now, go back to Terminal.    Run rake db:migrate to run your new migration against your application’s database.    $ rake db:migrate  == 20161227020938 AddDescriptionToBooks: migrating ============================  -- add_column(:books, :description, :text)     -&gt; 0.0049s  == 20161227020938 AddDescriptionToBooks: migrated (0.0050s) ===================Let’s take a look at how this changes your bookstore.      In Terminal, start rails console, get your first book and assign it to a variable called my_first_book.    my_first_book = Book.first        Does the book look different?    At the end, you should see a nil description.    #&lt;Book id: 1, title: \"why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby\", ..., description: nil&gt;        description is nil because you just added it.        You can give my_first_book a description by running    my_first_book.update(description: \"YOUR INSPIRING DESCRIPTION\")        Where YOUR INSPIRING DESCRIPTION is…YOUR INSPIRING DESCRIPTION.    (Don’t worry about your description being inspiring 😉)        After you’ve added YOUR INSPIRING DESCRIPTION to my_first_book, you can run my_first_book.description to see the new description.        Go ahead and add descriptions for the of rest your books. Your application’s database should have seven books, which means you have six descriptions to write.        When you’re done, exit the rails console and restart your application’s web server by running rails server.    $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; my_first_book = Book.first  &gt;&gt; my_first_book.update(description: \"An introductory book to the Ruby programming language, written by why the lucky stiff.

Reopen app/views/books/show.html.erb and add the book’s description to the end of the definition list.        What did you come up with?

Let’s link them!Since you have a books index with a little bit of book information and book views lots of specific information, it makes sense to link from the books index to specific book pages.If a visitor to your bookstore is really excited to see a book on the index, they could click on that book to get more detailed information about it.We’ll update the index so book titles link to their book’s page.In HTML, you add links using anchor elements (&lt;a&gt; tags). Anchor elements link to other pages by their href attribute.Fortunately, Rails gives us a convience method to abstract away some of that work.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/index.html.erb.        Change the list item that renders book titles and authors to this:    &lt;li&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(book.title, book_path(book)) %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;        Rails gives us a link_to method we can use to create anchor elements.    First, you give it the text for the link. In this case, we want to use the book’s title as the link text.    Then, you give it the path for the link. We want the link to go to /books/:id, but we passed it book_path(book). book_path(book) is another Rails method. Long story short, it generates /books/:id for the given book.        Save your changes and go to http://localhost:3000/books. Try clicking all the links!    When you’re done, stop your application’s web server.  123456789  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= link_to(book.title, book_path(book)) %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;",

In most web applications, you enter data through…the web.Your bookstore is a web application, so let’s treat it like one. Let’s set up your application so you can create books from your browser.      Open Terminal and go to the bookstore directory.        Now, run rake routes.    We’ve worked through a couple of the books routes. First, we used the index action to list all your application’s books. Then, we used the show action to show details for a given book.    Now, we’ll use the new action to create a new book.        The path for the new action is /books/new.    new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)      books#new        Let’s try going to that path.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rake routes     Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action      books GET    /books(.:format)          books#index            POST   /books(.:format)          books#create   new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)      books#new  edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format) books#edit       book GET    /books/:id(.:format)      books#show            PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            PUT    /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            DELETE /books/:id(.:format)      books#destroy      In Terminal, start your application’s web server by running rails server.        Now, try going to http://localhost:3000/books/new.        You got an error, but doesn’t it look familiar?

What does your BooksController look like? Does it have a new action?The BooksController doesn’t have a new action because we haven’t defined it yet.      In your text editor, open the BooksController (app/controllers/boooks_controller.rb).        At the end of the BooksController add the new method.    def newend            Save your changes, and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new.  12345678910111213  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new    end  endAnother error, but it should also look familiar.BooksController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.You’ve added the new method to the BooksController, but you haven’t created the new action’s template.Let’s add it!

When you login to a site, you enter your credentials into a form. When you post a status on Facebook, you enter your status into a form. When you’re Googling for programming resources, you enter your search terms into a form.After you add your data to a form, you submit it by clicking a submit button. For example, a login form might have a submit button that says “Login”.We’re going to use forms to create new books in your application.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/new.html.erb and add the following code:    &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        form_for is a method provided by Rails. It provides a consistent interface to build forms inside Rails applications.    Here, we’re passing @book to form_for because we want to create a form for a book.    form_for takes a block as its last argument. We haven’t done anything interesting inside the block, but that’ll change soon 😉        Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new.  12  &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;Hmm…an error.You’re seeing an ArgumentError in Books#new. There’s a lot going on in the error, but the message has a helpful hint.First argument in form cannot contain nil or be emptyRemember the code we used to start the form?&lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;@book is the first argument in the form, so the error is telling us @book must be nil or empty.How could @book be nil?      Open the BooksController in your text editor and take a look at the new method.    Is @book defined inside in the new method?    def newend        It’s nowhere to be found! That explains that error 😅  12345678910111213  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new    end  endLet’s fix that error.      Inside the BooksController new method, add the following line:    @book = Book.new        @book is set to be a new book because we want to create a form for new books.        Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new.    No errors! But we still have a blank page. Let’s start building out that form.  1234567891011121314  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end  end      In your text editor, open app/views/books.new.html.erb.        Inside the form_for block, add the following:    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;    &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;    &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        We’re putting your form elements inside an unordered list. The form will have two fields, one for title and one for author.    f.label defines labels for each field.    f.text_field creates a text input field for each field.

Try adding a field for the price. Remember, we named the field price_cents.        What did you come up with? If you followed the pattern used for the other two fields, you probably came up with something like this:    &lt;li&gt;  &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;  &lt;%= f.text_field :price_cents %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;        That works well, but price_cents isn’t a text field. It’s a number.    To make it a number field, simply change    &lt;%= f.text_field :price_cents %&gt;        to    &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;            Your full solution should look like this:    &lt;li&gt;  &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;  &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;        Update your solution, save your changes, and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new.    Does the price_cents field differ from other fields on the page?  1234567891011121314151617  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;We have a couple more fields to add to the form. We need fields for quantity and description.      Add quantity to your form as a number_field.        Add description to your form as a text_area.    (text_area differs from text_field by offering more space for text - which is useful for long descriptions.)        What does your solution look like? Your complete form should look like this:    &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :quantity %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :quantity %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :description %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_area :description %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            Update your solution to match this solution and save your changes.  Now you have a beautiful form full of fields. You can enter so much book data! 😍But there’s no way for you to save that data in your application’s database 😞Don’t worry! We can fix that!      At the end of the form_for block`, add the following line:    &lt;%= f.submit %&gt;        This will add a submission button to your form.        Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new.    f.submit generates a button labeled “Create Book”.  12345678910111213141516171819  &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;        &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;        &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;        &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;%= f.submit %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;      Now that you have a form with a shiny “Create Book” button, why don’t you try creating a book?    Fill out the form and click “Create Book”.        Error? ERROR?!        You’re getting an Unknown action error that says “The action ‘create’ could not be found for BooksController”.    Huh?    We’ve been working with the BooksController new action? How did we end up with an error for the create action?  Take a look at what happened in your application’s web server when you clicked “Create Book”.Started POST \"/books\" for ::1 at 2016-12-27 14:32:50 -0500AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The action 'create' could not be found for BooksController):Before the error happened, the server received a POST request to the /books path. This request happened when you clicked the “Create Book” button.Your form’s data was submitted as a POST request to the /books path.Real interesting, right? Let’s take a look at your application routes again.      Go back to Terminal and stop your application’s web server by running Ctrl-C. Then, run rake routes.        Take a look at the second row of the routing table.    POST   /books(.:format)          books#create        Does that look familiar? 😉    POST requests to /books get sent to the BooksController create action!    It looks like we were destined to reach the BooksController create action, but how did the form know to go there?    By default, a form_for with a new record will be wired up to POST requests to its matching create action.    In our case, we setup form_for with a new book. Therefore, the form was setup to POST to the BooksController create action.    Does this make sense to you? If it does, I’m impressed. I’m having a hard time understanding it all. 😅        Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything that is going on. It will make more sense over time.    The key take away here is the new book form gets submitted to the BooksController create action.

Then, it should look pretty much the same…)To get the book data that’s POSTed to the server, we need to access the book key in the params hash.      Add the following code to your BooksController create method:    Book.create(title: params[:book][:title], author: params[:book][:author], price_cents: params[:book][:price_cents], quantity: params[:book][:quantity], description: params[:book][:description])        We’re using Book.create to create a new book.

Now, run rails console and get the last book in your database.    Does it look familiar?    It’s the book you created!

It hasn’t been that long?Anyways…Things are coming together nicely. Let’s take a look at cleaning some stuff up. First, we’ll start with the BooksController.      Open the BooksController in your text editor and take a look at the create method.        In the first line of the create method, you’re calling Book.create and setting attributes one by one from the params hash.    Book.create(title: params[:book][:title], author: params[:book][:author], price_cents: params[:book][:price_cents], quantity: params[:book][:quantity], description: params[:book][:description])        Do you notice a pattern in the attributes that are being set?    Every attribute that you’re setting is in params[:book].    title: params[:book][:title]author: params[:book][:author]price_cents: params[:book][:price_cents]...        Since every attribute you’re setting is in params[:book], we can simplify that line.        Change Book.create from    Book.create(title: params[:book][:title], author: params[:book][:author], price_cents: params[:book][:price_cents], quantity: params[:book][:quantity], description: params[:book][:description])        to    Book.create(params[:book])            Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new, and try creating a book.  12345678910111213141516171819  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(params[:book])      redirect_to books_path    end  endSo…that didn’t work.The change we made is valid, but we’re running into a Rails security feature.Rails won’t let you set several attributes at once with data from a request. In this case, the data came from a request you generated. However, it’s not hard to imagine a malicious user sending harmful data.Before you can set several attributes at once from request data, you have to explicitly state which attributes can be set. That’s why you’re seeing an ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError - you haven’t permitted any attributes.This security feature is called strong parameters.      Reopen your BooksController.        To use strong parameters, change Book.create from    Book.create(params[:book])        to    Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)        When we want to create a book from the params hash, the params hash must have a book hash. From the book hash, we’ll get any of the permitted attributes and assign them to the new book.        Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new, and try creating a book again.  12345678910111213141516171819  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))      redirect_to books_path    end  endTo create books in the browser, you’ve been going directly to http://localhost:3000/books/new. That works, but it isn’t very convenient.Let’s add a link to the book index that will take us to http://localhost:3000/books/new.      Open app/view/books/index.html.erb in your text editor.        After the unordered list, add the following line:    &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path) %&gt;        We’re using the link_to helper to create a link. The link’s text will be “Add a book”, and it will link to the new_book_path (/books/new).        Save your changes and go to http://localhost:3000/books/new.    You should see the new link. Clicking it should take you to the new book form.  1234567891011  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= link_to(book.title, book_path(book)) %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path) %&gt;Now you can add all the books you heart desires from the comfort of your browser.

What about if the price changes?You’d have to open rails console to change your book’s data. That doesn’t sound very great.What if you could update books in your browser? Wouldn’t that be a little easier?Let’s make it so you can can update books in the browser.      Open Terminal and go to your bookstore directory. Then, run rake routes.        Now that we want to edit and update books, a couple of rows in the routing table should stand out.    First, take a look at the row with edit_book.    edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format) books#edit        The path to edit_book is /books/:id/edit. Doesn’t that look a little familiar?

Me either. 😅However, you might have guessed that the request was going to error. You added the edit action to the BooksController, but it doesn’t have a template to render.Let’s add it.      Go back to Terminal and stop your application’s web server.        Run touch app/views/books/edit.html.erb to create the edit book template.        Restart your application’s web server and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/edit.    A blank page has never looked better!    $ rails server  ...  ^CExiting  $ touch app/views/books/edit.html.erb  $ rails serverIn the edit template, we’ll take advantage of forms again. We’ll use them to gather new book data.Before we add the form to the template, let’s make some of the existing book data available.      Open the BooksController and add the following line inside the edit method:    @book = Book.find(params[:id])        (Doesn’t that look a lot like the show method?)        Save your changes.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end  endThe edit book form is going be similiar to the new book form.Remember what the new book form looked like?&lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :quantity %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :quantity %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :description %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_area :description %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= f.submit %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;Let’s start the edit book form by adding a field to edit the book’s title.      Open app/views/books/edit.html.erb in your text editor and add the following:    &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            Save your changes and revist http://localhost:3000/books/1/edit.  Whoa! The title is already filled-in!In the BooksController edit method, you found the requested book in your database and assigned it to @book. When you called form_for in app/views/books/edit.html.erb, you passed it @book.Since @book is a book in your database with a title, the title text_field was populated with @book’s title.(Magic)      Update the form so it has fields for all the book attributes: title, author, price_cents, quantity, and description.    Use the new book form in app/views/books/new.html.erb as an example.        How’s your form look? It should look like this:    &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :quantity %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :quantity %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :description %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_area :description %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            Update your solution to match this solution.

Open app/views/books/edit.html.erb and add a submit button as the last line inside the form_for block.    &lt;%= f.submit %&gt;        This will add a button to your form labeled “Update Book”.

Try making a change to the book and submitting the form.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update    end  endNothing happened!The form is being submitted to the BooksController update method, and the method is…empty. I think I’d be more surprised if something did happen. 😉The update method should probably do something. Maybe it should update the book.      First, let’s find the book you’re trying to update.    Open the BooksController and add the following line insided the update method:    book = Book.find(params[:id])        We’ve done this in a few of the BooksController methods.    Now that we have the book, how will we update it?    You’ve updated books before. Do you remember when you added descriptions to all your books? How did you do it?    You did something along the lines of my_first_book.update(description: \"Woooo\").    You called the update method on each of your books to give them descriptions. We’ll use update again to make the requested changes.        We could simply do book.update(params[:book]), but that won’t work because of strong parameters.    Instead, add the following line to the end of the BooksController update method.    book.update(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))            Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/edit, make some changes, and submit that form!  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))    end  endWhere are my changes?!Nothing happened, right?Go to http://localhost:3000/books/1, and make sure to refresh the page.Your change is there!Don’t believe me? Try making another change?How are changes happening when it looks like the form isn’t being submitted?The form is being submitted to the BooksController update method, and the requested changes are being made to the book. But that’s where the update method ends. It looks like nothing happened because there’s no visual queue that something happened.After a book is updated, let’s redirect to that book’s details. That way, we can see the changes.      At the end of the BooksController update method, add the following line:    redirect_to book_path(book)            Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/edit, and try making another change. When you submit your changes, you should be redirected to the first book’s details. Keep an out to see your changes.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))      redirect_to book_path(book)    end  endYay! In addition to adding books from the browser, you can now edit books too.Before we move on, let’s take a look at cleaning up some stuff. Let’s start with the BooksController.In both the create and update methods of the BooksController, you’re authorizing and getting the same params.def create  Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))  ...end...def update  ...  book.update(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))  ...endFortunately, there’s a convention to help manage this shared bit of code.      Open the BooksController in your text editor, and add the following code to the end of it:    def book_params  params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)end        By defining a new book_params method, we have one place to deal with getting and authorizing book params.        Now, update the create method so it uses book_params. Change    Book.create(params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description))        to    Book.create(book_params)            Make the same change to the update method.        Save your changes and try creating and editing books. Everything should still work the same as it did before these changes.  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(book_params)      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(book_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def book_params      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)    end  endLet’s make one more change to improve the edit workflow.Right now, you can only edit books if you know the edit_book_path URL. Let’s make this a little user-friendly by adding a link to the edit page from the book show page.      Open app/views/books/show.html.erb in your text editor. Add the following line to the end of the file:    &lt;%= link_to \"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book) %&gt;        This will create a link with text “Edit book”. It will link to the edit_book_path for @book which will evaluate to /books/:id/edit.    Adding the link here works really well because we already have the book we want to edit as @book.        Save your changes and visit a few books. Clicking the “Edit book” link should take you to the edit page for the book you’re viewing.        When you’re done exploring, stop your application’s web server.  123456789101112131415161718192021  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents / 100.0) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Description&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.description %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;  &lt;%= link_to \"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book) %&gt;",

However, there are a few changes we can make that’ll make your bookstore easier to use.We’ll add a CSS file to add some style rules. Then, we’ll update your templates to take advantage of the new style rules.      Download the stylesheet file bookstore.scss here.        Move bookstore.scss to app/assets/stylesheets.    Rails will automatically load all stylesheet files defined in app/assets/stylesheets.    $ ls -l app/assets/stylesheets  total 16  -rw-r--r--  1 awesomesauce  staff   736 Dec 30 12:13 application.css  -rw-r--r--  1 awesomesauce  staff  2812 Dec 30 12:14 bookstore.scssHey - I thought we were adding a CSS file?! What’s a .scss file?bookstore.scss is a Sass file!As they say at the top of their homepage, Sass is “CSS with superpowers.”We can use both Sass and CSS files in your application because Rails ships with support for both.If you’re curious, you can read the Sass docs to learn more about it.Now that your application has some styles, let’s use them!Let’s start by adding a header that will get rendered on every page.      Open app/views/layouts/application.html.erb in your text editor.    This file makes up the skeleton of every page in your application.    All your content is rendered inside the body tag.    &lt;body&gt;  &lt;%= yield %&gt;&lt;/body&gt;            After the beginning of the body tag, add the following code:    &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;  &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;    &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", books_path %&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        On every page of your bookstore, there will be a header with a link labeled “My Super Rad Bookstore” that links to the books index. No matter what page your on, you’ll be able to get back to your bookstore’s main page.        Now, let’s add a containing div around your application’s content.    Inside the body tag, change the yield line from    &lt;%= yield %&gt;        to    &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;  &lt;%= yield %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        This let’s us add some styling to make your application’s content consistent across the different pages.        Save your changes.  12345678910111213141516171819202122  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Bookstore&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;      &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;      &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;        &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", books_path %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;        &lt;%= yield %&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;      Now, let’s take a look at the books index. Open app/views/books/index.html.erb.        At the end of the template, you have a link to add a book.    Let’s make that link look like a button. This will help people recognize the link as an actionable item.        Change the link from    &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path) %&gt;        to    &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path, class: \"button\") %&gt;        With this change, you’re adding a CSS class called button to the link. The CSS class button is defined in bookstore.scss.        Save your changes.  1234567891011  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= link_to(book.title, book_path(book)) %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path, class: \"button\") %&gt;Now that we have some styles in place, let’s see what they look like.

Doesn’t it look so different?!Let’s add a few more finishing touches.      Open app/views/books/new.html.erb.        We’ll add the button CSS class to the form submission button to make it look like a…button.    Trust me, it’ll be a really good looking button 😉        Change the submit button from    &lt;%= f.submit %&gt;        to    &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\" )%&gt;        This change is very simmilar to the change we made to the “Add a book” link. Before, you weren’t passing any arguments to the submit button. Now, you’re setting the class to button.

Can you guess which one it is?It’s a sneaky one - the “Edit book” link on the book details page.Once again, we’ll style the link as a button to help people recognize it as an actionable item.      Open app/views/books/show.html.erb.        Just as we’ve done before, add the button class as the last option to the link.

Take a look at http://localhost:3000.The default Rails homepage is a great way to verify things are working when you’re just getting started, but we’re well past that.The books index at http://localhost:3000/books is your application’s true homepage, so let’s treat it that way!To make the books index your application’s homepage, we’ll need to update your application’s routes.      Open config/routes.rb in your text editor.        Before the line with resources :books, add the following line:    root \"books#index\"        This will update your application’s routes so requests to http://localhost:3000 get routed to the BooksController index action.        Save your changes.  123456  Rails.application.routes.draw do    # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html    root \"books#index\"    resources :books  endLet’s take a look at how the change to config/routes.rb changed your application’s routes.      Go back to Terminal, stop your application’s web server, and run rake routes.    You might not notice it, but there’s a new row at the beginning of the table.    root GET    /                         books#index        The root route has an empty path (there’s nothing after /).        It’s a small change, but it’s pretty powerful.

        "title": "Deleting a Book",
        "content": "Deleting a BookYour bookstore is starting to feel like a fully featured application. You can list, view, add, and edit books. Is there anything else you might want to do with your books?Maybe you accidentally added a book you don’t have, or a book is no longer available. When these situations happen, wouldn’t it be nice if you could delete the book?Let’s add the ability to delete books.Let’s start by looking at your application’s routes.      Open Terminal and go to the bookstore directory.        Now, run rake routes.    Can you guess which path we’ll use to delete a book?    It’s in the last row of the routing table:    DELETE /books/:id(.:format)      books#destroy        A DELETE request to /books/:id will get routed to the BooksController destroy action.        Let’s try visiting that path.    Start your application’s web server and go to http://localhost:3000/books/1.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rake routes     Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action       root GET    /                         books#index      books GET    /books(.:format)          books#index            POST   /books(.:format)          books#create   new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)      books#new  edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format) books#edit       book GET    /books/:id(.:format)      books#show            PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            PUT    /books/:id(.:format)      books#update            DELETE /books/:id(.:format)      books#destroy  $ rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000What happened when you went to http://localhost:3000/books/1?You pulled up the details for the first book in your application’s database.But I thought we were going to be deleting booksAll Kinds of RequestsWhen you visit http://localhost:3000/books/1, you send a GET request to your application’s web server. GET requests to /books/:id don’t have anything to do with deleting books.book GET    /books/:id(.:format)      books#showGET requests to /books/:id get routed to the BooksController show action. To delete a book, we need to send a DELETE request to /books/:id.DELETE /books/:id(.:format)      books#destroyThis may seem foreign, but we actually ran into this before when we were updating books.To reach the BooksController update action, we also send a request to /books/:id. However, this request is either a PATCH or PUT request.PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)      books#updatePUT    /books/:id(.:format)      books#updateDo you remember doing anything special to handle the different request type? Me neither. 😊You’ve been sending PATCH/PUT requests to update books thanks to form_for.&lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;With that one line, you created a form that is submitted as a PATCH/PUT request to your application’s web server.We’ll do something similiar to generate DELETE requests to delete books.To delete a book, we’ll add a “Delete Book” button to the book details page.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/show.html.erb.        At the end of the file, add the following line:    &lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;        This will create a button labeled “Delete Book”. When the button is clicked, a request will be sent to book_path for the given book (/books/:id). The request will be a DELETE request because the method is set to :delete.    The button has a couple of styling rules. First, the button will be styled as a…button. We’ll also want the button to stand out because it’s potentially dangerous. (We don’t want anyone to accidentally delete a book). To make it stand out, we’ll add the danger class.        Save your changes, and find a book you don’t like. If you like all your books, find one you could live without. 😝    Once you’ve found that book, go to its details page in the browser. Find the “Delete Book” button and click it.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents / 100.0) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Description&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.description %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;  &lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;Ahh, another Unknown action error. Feels just like home. 😅      Spend a few minutes to see if you can get past the Unknown action error.    Instead of erroring, the button should do nothing.        Did you get it?! The BooksController needs a destroy method.        If you haven’t already, add an empty destroy method to your BooksController.  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(book_params)      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(book_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def book_params      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)    end    def destroy    end  endNow you have a “Delete Book” button that doesn’t do anything. Let’s change that.      In the BooksController destroy method, you need to first find the book you want to destroy. Then, you’ll want to call destroy on the book to delete it from your database.    book.destroy        After the book is deleted, you’ll redirect to the books index page. This will let you verify that the book is no longer in your database.        Given this description, try wiring up the BooksController destroy method. Use the other BooksController methods for guidance, and compare your work with others around you.        What did you come up with?!    Your solution should look something like this:    def destroy  book = Book.find(params[:id])  book.destroy  redirect_to books_pathend            Don’t worry if your solution doesn’t look exactly like this. As long as you’re destroying the requested book and redirecting to the books index, you’re good.    If that’s not the case, update your solution to match this one.        Save your changes and delete some books! 😈        When you’re done wreaking havoc, stop your application’s web server.  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(book_params)      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(book_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def book_params      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)    end    def destroy      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.destroy      redirect_to books_path    end  end",

        "title": "Reviewing a Book",
        "content": "Reviewing a BookYour bookstore is full of wonderful books. Although they have some great descriptions, your books deserve great advocates!Your books need reviews. 😉Before we can add reviews, we need a place to store them. Let’s add a new table to your database.      Open Terminal and go to your bookstore directory.        Now, run rails generate model review.    You might remember running this command when we created the books table.    rails generate model review creates a bunch of files.    invoke  active_recordcreate    db/migrate/20170103220053_create_reviews.rbcreate    app/models/review.rbinvoke    test_unitcreate      test/models/review_test.rbcreate      test/fixtures/reviews.yml        The first file it creates is a migration file. We’ve already created a few of these in your bookstore application.    $ ls -l db/migratetotal 24-rw-r--r--  1 alimi  staff  230 Dec 30 12:00 20161115030350_create_books.rb-rw-r--r--  1 alimi  staff  125 Dec 30 12:00 20161227020938_add_description_to_books.rb        Migration files always have file names that start with the timestamp of when they were created.    Let’s take a look at the migration that was generated by rails generate model review.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rails generate model review        invoke  active_record        create    db/migrate/20170103220053_create_reviews.rb        create    app/models/review.rb        invoke    test_unit        create      test/models/review_test.rb        create      test/fixtures/reviews.yml      In your text editor, open the CreateReviews migration (db/migrations/TIMESTAMP_create_reviews.rb).        Take a look at the change method. It has a create_table block that will create the reviews table.    def change  create_table :reviews do |t|    t.timestamps  endend        If you ran the migration as it is now, your reviews table wouldn’t have anything other than the created_at and updated_at timestamps. We’ll need to change the create_table block so your new reviews table can store more review related data. 😄  12345678  class CreateReviews &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :reviews do |t|        t.timestamps      end    end  endThe reviews table will need a column to store the text of a review. Let’s call that column body, and let’s make it a text column so you can leave long, inspiring reviews.      Using your other migrations as an example, update the create_table block of your CreateReviews migration to add a text column called body to your reviews table.        When you’re done, save your changes, and run the migration by running rake db:migrate.    If you make any mistakes, you can always undo the migration by running rake db:rollback. Then, you can make changes to your CreateReviews migration and re-run it with rake db:migrate.        How did you update the migration?    You needed to add one line to the create_table block.    t.text :body            If you didn’t already, add this line to your migration.    If you ran the migration without adding the body column, you’ll need to rollback and re-run the migration.  123456789  class CreateReviews &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :reviews do |t|        t.text :body        t.timestamps      end    end  endNow that we have reviews, let’s play with them on the rails console.      Go to Terminal and start the rails console.        You now have a new object you can use: Review.    Try running Review.new. It will return a new, empty Review.    #&lt;Review id: nil, body: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;        In addition to id, created_at, and updated_at, the new review also has a body.        Using the Review class, create two reviews.    The same methods you used to create books can be used to create reviews.    When you’re done Review.count should return 2.    $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; Review.new  =&gt; #&lt;Review id: nil, body: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;      Did you create two reviews? How did you do it?    Maybe you created a review by using create.    Review.create(body: \"Wow, what a great book!\")        Or maybe you started with a new review and called save on it.    a_new_review = Review.newa_new_review.body = \"10/10 would recommend\"a_new_review.save        You might’ve even come up with something totally different!            If you get 2 when you run Review.count, yay!    If not, use either of the methods we described to create two reviews.  Associating Reviews to BooksNow you have a couple of reviews, but doesn’t it feel like we’re missing something?How are these reviews related to books?They’re not 😅Fortunately, Rails gives us a few tools to associate reviews to books.In this case, we can say a review should only belong to one book. This is called a belongs_to relationship.Let’s define the belongs_to relationship.      In your text editor, open app/models/review.rb.        Inside the Review class, add the following line.    belongs_to :book        With this change, we’re setting up your application so a Review belongs_to a Book.        Save your changes.  123  class Review &lt; ApplicationRecord    belongs_to :book  end      Go back to the rails console and run reload! to pick up your changes.        Now, get your first review from the database and assign it to a variable called my_first_review.    my_first_review = Review.first            Let’s try to get my_first_review’s book.    Run my_first_review.book.    That returned nil because my_first_review was never associated with a book.        Let’s try assigning your first book to your first review.    Run the following:    my_first_review.book = Book.first        That returned an error, didn’t it? 🙃        It might be hard to see, but you actually got a pretty useful error…    ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: can't write unknown attribute `book_id`        We’ve defined the belongs_to relationship between review and book, but we need a way to save that relationship in your database. To do that, we’ll need to add a book_id column to your reviews table.        Let’s make that change to the reviews table, but before you move on exit the rails console.    &gt;&gt; reload!  Reloading...  =&gt; true  &gt;&gt; my_first_review = Review.first    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"reviews\".* FROM \"reviews\" ORDER BY \"reviews\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT ?  [[\"LIMIT\", 1]]  =&gt; #&lt;Review id: 1, body: \"Wow, what a great book!\", created_at: \"2017-01-04 02:07:50\", updated_at: \"2017-01-04 02:07:50\"&gt;  &gt;&gt; my_first_review.book  =&gt; nil  &gt;&gt; my_first_review.book = Book.first    Book Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  \"books\".* FROM \"books\" ORDER BY \"books\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT ?  [[\"LIMIT\", 1]]  ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: can't write unknown attribute `book_id`  ...  &gt;&gt; exitTo add a book_id column to the reviews table, we’ll need a new migration.Remember, editing an old migration would mean rolling back that migration and we don’t want to do that because that would delete the data in the database.      In Terminal, run rails generate migration add_book_id_to_reviews.    This will generate a new timestamped migration called AddBookIdToReviews.        Do you remember when you added description to the books table?    class AddDescriptionToBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]  def change    add_column :books, :description, :text  endend        We’ll want to do something similiar to add the book_id column to the reviews table.        Open the AddBookIdToReviews migration in your text editor (db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_add_book_id_to_reviews.rb).        Using the AddDescriptionToBooks migration as an example, update the AddBookIdToReviews migration so a book_id column is added to the reviews table. The book_id column should be an integer column.    $ rails generate migration add_book_id_to_reviews        invoke  active_record        create    db/migrate/20170104024335_add_book_id_to_reviews.rb      What does your solution look like?    Inside the change method, you should have the following line:    add_column :reviews, :book_id, :integer        This will add a book_id column to the reviews table, and the new column will be an integer column.        Update your solution to match this solution and save your changes.  12345  class AddBookIdToReviews &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      add_column :reviews, :book_id, :integer    end  end      Now go back to Terminal and run your migration!    rake db:migrate            If you pay close attention to the output, you can see the book_id column getting added to the reviews table.    $ rake db:migrate  == 20170104024335 AddBookIdToReviews: migrating ===============================  -- add_column(:reviews, :book_id, :integer)     -&gt; 0.0073s  == 20170104024335 AddBookIdToReviews: migrated (0.0074s) ======================Now that the reviews table has a book_id column, you can assign books to reviews. Let’s try it!      Open rails console and run the following code to assign your first book to your first review.    my_first_review = Review.firstmy_first_review.book = Book.firstmy_first_review.save            Now, try running my_first_review.book.    Yay! 🎉    Your first review is now associated with your first book.    If you look at my_first_review, you’ll notice its book_id is 1 - your first book’s id.        Go ahead and assign your second review to your first book. While you’re at it, also create another review for your first book.    When you’re done, Review.count should return 3.    $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; my_first_review = Review.first    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"reviews\".* FROM \"reviews\" ORDER BY \"reviews\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT ?

In your text editor, open app/models/book.rb, and add the followling line inside the class    has_many :reviews        This will set up your application so a Book has_many Reviews.    In addition, we won’t have to make any database changes because the reviews table already has a book_id column. The relationship is already defined in the database.        Save your changes.  123  class Book &lt; ApplicationRecord    has_many :reviews  end      Now, go back to the rails console and run reload! to get you newest changes.        Get your first book and assign it to my_first_book.        Now, try running my_first_book.reviews.    It might be hard to see, but all your book reviews are there!            Don’t believe me??    Try running my_first_book.reviews.count. It should return 3.        Spend some time playing around with this relationship. You can do things like my_first_book.reviews.first or my_first_book.reviews.pluck(:body).    To find a complete list of all the things you can do, take a look at the documentation here.

Open Terminal, go to your bookstore directory, and start your application’s web server.        Now, open the details page for your first book (http://localhost:3000/books/1).    This page shows the details of your first book, and your first book has reviews. Doesn’t this feel like a good place to show those reviews?    › pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  › rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000How Do Book Details Get Rendered Again?Do you remember how the book details page gets rendered?When you go to http://localhost:3000/books/1, a GET request is sent to your application’s web server. This request gets routed to the BooksController show method.def show  @id = params[:id]  @book = Book.find(@id)endIn the show method, you made the requested book’s data available by assigning the book to @book. Then, the show template (app/views/books/show.html.erb) can use @book to show the book’s data.Since the show template has access to the book, it also has access to the book’s reviews.We can take advantage of this to show a book’s reviews.      In your text editor, open app/views/books/show.html.erb.        Let’s start by showing how many reviews the book has. Add the following line before the “Edit book” link:    &lt;p&gt; Number of reviews: &lt;%= @book.reviews.count %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;            Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1.

Maybe, in an unordered list?    Didn’t we do something like this already?    Yeah! You used an unordered list to show books on the books index (app/views/books/index.html.erb).    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= link_to(book.title, book_path(book)) %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        For each book in @books, you added a list item (li) to the unordered list (ul) with some information about the book.    We’ll want to do something similiar for book reviews.        Using the books index as an example, add an unordered list to the show template with the book’s reviews.    Add the unordered list before the “Edit book” link. For each review, add a list item with the review’s body.        What does your unordered list look like? It should look something like this:    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;% @book.reviews.each do |review| %&gt;    &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;            If you didn’t come up with a similar solution, update your solution to match this one.        Save your changes, and go check out those reviews!

        "content": "Adding Reviews from the BrowserNow you can see your beautiful reviews, but wouldn’t it be nice if you could also add reviews??      Let’s start by taking a look at your application’s routes file. In your text editor, open config/routes.rb.    So far, you’ve specified one resource in your routes file - books.    resources :books        It’s been a while since we’ve been inside the routes file, but your application now has a new resource - reviews. You’ve defined a relationship between these two resources in your application. A book can have many reviews, and review belongs to a book.    We can define this relationship in your routes file.        In your routes file, change    resources :books        to    resources :books do  resources :reviewsend            Save your changes.  12345678  Rails.application.routes.draw do    # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html    root \"books#index\"    resources :books do      resources :reviews    end  endLet’s see how that changed your application’s routes.      Open Terminal, go to the bookstore directory, and run rake routes.    Whoa! Your application’s routing table got waaaaay bigger.    Your application now has a bunch of review routes. Do you notice a pattern in their paths?    /books/:book_id/reviews/books/:book_id/reviews/books/:book_id/reviews/new        They all start with /books/:book_id because of the change you made to your application’s routes file:    resources :books do  resources :reviewsend        By nesting :reviews inside of :books, you’re setting up all your review routes to go through the book they belong to.    For example, instead of having a route to get all your application’s reviews (/reviews), you have a route to get all of a books reviews (/books/:book_id/reviews).    Why are we doing this again?    We’re setting up your application’s routes to reflect the belongs_to/has_many relationship that exists between books and reviews.    It might feel a little abstract, but this will come in handy when we’re adding reviews.    › pwd  /Users/alimi/Projects/bookstore  › rake routes            Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                                Controller#Action              root GET    /                                          books#index      book_reviews GET    /books/:book_id/reviews(.:format)          reviews#index                   POST   /books/:book_id/reviews(.:format)          reviews#create   new_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/new(.:format)      reviews#new  edit_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id/edit(.:format) reviews#edit       book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#show                   PATCH  /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#update                   PUT    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#update                   DELETE /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#destroy             books GET    /books(.:format)                           books#index                   POST   /books(.:format)                           books#create          new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)                       books#new         edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format)                  books#edit              book GET    /books/:id(.:format)                       books#show                   PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)                       books#update                   PUT    /books/:id(.:format)                       books#update                   DELETE /books/:id(.:format)                       books#destroyWhat Route Do We Use to Add Reviews?Given the changes to your application’s routes, what route would we use to add new reviews?One route stands out:new_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/new(.:format)      reviews#newI mean…it has a prefix of new_book_review. 😉Let’s try visiting that path.

There’s one key piece of information burried in the weeds.ReviewsController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.We’re missing a template!      First, go back to Terminal and stop your application’s web server.        Now, you’ll need to create directory for the review templates. Run the following command:    mkdir app/views/reviews        This created an empty reviews directory inside of app/views.        Then, you can create the new reviews template with the following command:    touch app/views/reviews/new.html.erb            Restart your application’s web server, and try going back to http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new.

When you get there, you see a form where you can enter data for the new book you want to add.When you’re done adding the data for the new book, you click on “Create Book” to add the new book.We’re going to repeat this workflow, but instead of creating a book we’re going to create a review for a given book.Let’s get started by showing the title of the book that’s being reviewed at the top of the page.      Open the ReviewsController in your text editor, and add the following code to new method.    @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])        This will make the book’s data available in the new review template.        Save your changes.  12345  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])    end  end      Now, open app/views/reviews/new.html.erb and add the following line:    &lt;h1&gt; New review for &lt;%= @book.title %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;            Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new.    The top of the page should have a message that says “New review for why’s (poignant) Guide to Ruby”.        Try visiting the new review path for different books in your bookstore.    For example, to visit the new review path for the second book in your bookstore you would go to http://localhost:3000/books/2/reviews/new.    As you go to different paths, the message at the top of the page should change to show that book’s title.  1  &lt;h1&gt; New Review for &lt;%= @book.title %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;Now, we need to make the new review form.To get started, we’ll update the ReviewsController new method to make a new review available in the new review template.That’s a lot of new 😅      Open the ReviewsController and add the following line at the end of the new method.    @review = @book.reviews.build        This will create an empty review for the book that we can use in the new review template.        Save your changes.  123456  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end  endNow, we can build the review form!      This form is going to be pretty simmilar to the new book form, but with less fields.    &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :author %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :price_cents %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :price_cents %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :quantity %&gt;      &lt;%= f.number_field :quantity %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :description %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_area :description %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            Using the new book form as an example, add a new review form to app/views/reviews/new.html.erb. The only field you need to set on a review is its body.    When you’re done, try add a review!    Psst…not to be a downer, but chances are your solution won’t work  What did you come up with? If you’re anything like me, you followed the pattern in the new book form and came up with something like this:&lt;%= form_for(@review) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :body %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :body %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;For some reason, that doesn’t work. This solution leads to an error…This is a tricky error, but the gist of it is that we have an undefined method for reviews_path.By doing &lt;%= form_for(@review) do |f| %&gt;, we’re creating a form for a new review that will get submitted to the reviews_path. What’s wrong with that?We don’t have a reviews_path…we have a book_reviews_path.Do you remember what your application’s routes file looks like?Rails.application.routes.draw do  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html  root \"books#index\"  resources :books do    resources :reviews  endendReviews are resources nested under books. Therefore, all review routes have to be referenced through a book.      To make the new review form work, we need to change    &lt;%= form_for(@review) do |f| %&gt;        to    &lt;%= form_for([@book, @review]) do |f| %&gt;        With this change, the form will use the book_reviews_path instead of the invalid reviews_path.        Your form should now look like this:    &lt;%= form_for([@book, @review]) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :body %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :body %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        Update your form to match this solution.        Save your changes and try adding a review to your first book by visiting http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new.  123456789101112  &lt;h1&gt; New Review for &lt;%= @book.title %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;%= form_for([@book, @review]) do |f| %&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= f.label :body %&gt;        &lt;%= f.text_field :body %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;An Unknown action error?! But we were so close!!!Don’t be so down! We’ve gotten through this before…we can fix this.The error is telling us what we need to do.The action 'create' could not be found for ReviewsController.      Add an empty create method to the ReviewsController.    def createend            Save your changes and try adding a review for your first book again by visiting http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new.  123456789  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end    def create    end  endNothing happened, right?RIGHT?!?Of course nothing happened, the create method is empty.We need to update the ReviewsController create method so it creates a review for the requested book.      Add the followling lines to the ReviewsController create method:    book = Book.find(params[:book_id])book.reviews.create(params)        First, we find the requested book and assign it to a variable called book. Then, we create a review for the book using the data that was sent with the form. The data is available in the params hash.        Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new, and try adding a review one more time.  1234567891011  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end    def create      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      book.reviews.create(params)    end  endAre you really surprised to see another error? 😉What do you think is going on? You’re getting an ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError, but why?If you look closely at the browser, Rails is telling you where the problem is. It’s inside the create method.book.reviews.create(params)Why would you get an ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError from doing book.reviews.create(params)…🤔Check out the ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError doc. What does the description say?  Raised when forbidden attributes are used for mass assignment.Ah! We’re trying to create the review using all the data from the params hash, but we haven’t allowed any attributes to be set. This is that security feature we looked at earlier called strong parameters.Strong parameters forces us to explcitly state what attributes can be set to prevent malicious data from entering our applications. When you try to assign attributes that haven’t been permitted, you get an ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError error.To fix the ReviewsController create method, we need to specify the attributes that can be set on reviews. There is only one attribute we care about - body.      Add the following method to the end of the ReviewsController:    def review_params  params.require(:review).permit(:body)end        Inside this review_params method, we’re saying the params hash must have a review hash. Inside the review hash, we’ll allow a body attribute to be used on a new review.        Do you remember what the params hash looks like? It looks something like this:    {\"utf8\"=&gt;\"✓\", \"authenticity_token\"=&gt;\"JYZD9Lsnb6RbMX7OW/QUXNY6Uzxd0MYZNcDKHKZjAmggVeGwKb6lPkOE60zgptRlquzdhJo9tOU5r7mLthxXog==\", \"review\"=&gt;{\"body\"=&gt;\"Wooooooooo\"}, \"commit\"=&gt;\"Create Review\", \"book_id\"=&gt;\"1\"}        There’s a bunch of stuff in there, but now we’re restricted to only using the body attribute from the review hash.        Now we can use review_params inside the create method. Replace    book.reviews.create(params)        with    book.reviews.create(review_params)            Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new, and try adding a review!  123456789101112131415  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end    def create      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      book.reviews.create(review_params)    end    def review_params      params.require(:review).permit(:body)    end  endNothing happened…or did it?      Go back to your first book’s details page at http://localhost:3000/books/1.    Notice anything different???    Your new review!!! 🎉        Nothing happens at the end of the ReviewsController create method so it feels like your review wasn’t created. Let’s fix this.    Add the following line to the end of the ReviewsController create method:    redirect_to book_path(book)        After a review is added for the book, we’ll redirect to the book details page for the book so we can verify the new review was created.        Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new, and watch what happens when you add a new review.  12345678910111213141516  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end    def create      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      book.reviews.create(review_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def review_params      params.require(:review).permit(:body)    end  endYou’ve done a lot of work in this chapter, but look at your bookstore! Now you can write all those book reviews you’ve been putting off for all these years.Before you jump into writing those reviews, let’s clean up one more thing…To create a review for a book, you have to know the URL you want to visit. We can make this a little nicer by adding a link to the new review page from the book details pages.You’ll be able to quickly write a review for the book you’re looking at.      Let’s start by looking at your application’s routes. Go to Terminal, stop your application’s web server, and run rake routes.    Which row has the path we’ve been using to get to the new review page?    new_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/new(.:format)      reviews#new        The first column in the row is a prefix. The new review page has a prefix of new_book_review. We’ll use this prefix to build a link to the new review path.        Restart your application’s web server.    › rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  ...  ^CExiting  › rake routes            Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                                Controller#Action              root GET    /                                          books#index      book_reviews GET    /books/:book_id/reviews(.:format)          reviews#index                   POST   /books/:book_id/reviews(.:format)          reviews#create   new_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/new(.:format)      reviews#new  edit_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id/edit(.:format) reviews#edit       book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#show                   PATCH  /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#update                   PUT    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#update                   DELETE /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#destroy             books GET    /books(.:format)                           books#index                   POST   /books(.:format)                           books#create          new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)                       books#new         edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format)                  books#edit              book GET    /books/:id(.:format)                       books#show                   PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)                       books#update                   PUT    /books/:id(.:format)                       books#update                   DELETE /books/:id(.:format)                       books#destroy  › rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  ...

        "title": "Adding Users to Your Database",
        "content": "Adding Users to Your DatabaseHow does it feel to get all those reviews out of your system? I’m sure it feels good 😆You worked really hard to write those reviews, but how will anyone know you wrote them?What if people show up and start leaving reviews? How will you keep to track of who’s reviewing what?We need users!A user should be able to login to your bookstore. Once they’re logged in, any reviews they write can be attributed to them.We’ll start by adding users to your database.Let’s start by creating a migration for the users table.      Open Terminal and go to the bookstore directory.        Now, run rails generate model user.    This command should be a little familiar. We used it earlier when added the books and reviews tables. It will generate a CreateUsers migration.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rails generate model user        invoke  active_record        create    db/migrate/20170112224318_create_users.rb        create    app/models/user.rb        invoke    test_unit        create      test/models/user_test.rb        create      test/fixtures/users.yml      Open the CreateUsers migration in your text editor.    Remember, the CreateUsers migration file has a timestamped filename.    db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_create_users.rb  12345678  class CreateUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :users do |t|        t.timestamps      end    end  endThere’s a Pattern to Creating Tables in Migrations…Does the CreateUsers migration look familiar? It doesn’t do much yet, but it looks a lot like the CreateBooks and CreateReviews migrations.Take a look at the CreateBooks migration to refresh your memory.class CreateBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]  def change    create_table :books do |t|      t.string :title      t.string :author      t.integer :price_cents      t.timestamps      t.integer :quantity    end  endendJust like the CreateBooks migration, the CreateUsers migration has a change method. Inside the change method, there’s a create_table block with the name of the table to create. In the CreateBooks migration the table name is :books, but in the the CreateUsers migration it’s users.You define the columns you want to add to the table inside the create_table block. You added a bunch of columns in the CreateBooks migration, but you haven’t added any to the CreateUsers migration…yet 😉To support users logging in, we need to add a couple of columns to the users table.First, we’ll need to add a username for the…user’s name.Then, we’ll need to add a password_digest column. This will be used to securely store user passwords (more on that later).Both columns will be string columns.      Using your other migrations as examples, update the create_table block in the CreateUsers migration so username and password_digest are added as string columns to the users table.        When you’re done, save your changes, and run the migration by running rake db:migrate.    If you make any mistakes, you can always undo the migration by running rake db:rollback. Then, you can make changes to the CreateUsers migration and re-run it with rake db:migrate.  What does your solution look like?! Did you add the columns to the users table??      Your create_table block should look something like this:    create_table :users do |t|  t.string :username  t.string :password_digest  t.timestampsend            If your create_table block doesn’t look like this, update your solution to match this solution and run the migration.    If you ran the migration without the username or password_digest columns, you’ll need to rollback the migration and run it again.  123456789  class CreateUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      create_table :users do |t|        t.string :username        t.string :password_digest        t.timestamps      end    end  endWhat’s a Password Digest?Your bookstore application now has a users table with a couple of columns. The username column probably seems reasonable, but I’m sure the password_digest column looks questionable. What’s a password digest anyways?Rails provides a feature to make password management convienient. By adding the passowrd_digest column, you’ve already taken the first step towards using this feature.The next step is going to require a code change.      Open app/models/user.rb in your text editor.        Inside the User class, add the following line:    has_secure_password        This will call Rails’ has_secure_password method to make the password management feature available on all users.        Save your changes.  123  class User &lt; ApplicationRecord    has_secure_password  endLet’s see what we can do with the User class.      Go to Terminal and start the rails console.        Now, let’s try building your bookstore’s first user. Run the following code:    my_first_user = User.new(username: \"CatPower\")        Woah! That’s a gnarly error!        If you look closely at the error, it’s trying to tell you what’s wrong. It even has a suggestion on how you can fix it.    You don't have bcrypt installed in your application. Please add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install        Let’s break down this error, but first - exit the rails console.    $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; my_first_user = User.new(username: \"CatPower\")  You don't have bcrypt installed in your application. Please add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install  LoadError: cannot load such file -- bcrypt  ...  &gt;&gt; exitbcrypt, RubyGems, and GemfilesLet’s take a look at the first part of the error.You don't have bcrypt installed in your application.Your bookstore application doesn’t have bcrypt installed, and it never did. Why’s that a problem now?has_secure_password is being run on every User, including my_first_user. Under the hood, has_secure_password uses bcrypt to encrypt and save passwords.Since your bookstore application doesn’t have bcrypt, has_secure_password can’t run and it throws this error.Now that we have some idea of what the problem is, how can we fix it? Let’s take a look at the second part of the error.Please add it to your Gemfile and run bundle installHmm…I guess we have to add bcrypt to your Gemfile.What’s a Gemfile?Ah, a Gemfile! It’s a really important part of the Ruby ecosystem.A lot of Ruby projects have Gemfiles to manage the RubyGems they use.Huh…what’s a RubyGem?A RubyGem is a bundle of Ruby code that can be used in any Ruby project. Some RubyGems are small, and others are pretty big.RubyGems are usually referred to as Gems because who has time for all those syllables.bcrypt is a RubyGem.Your bookstore application is a Ruby project, it just happens to be a Rails application too 😉As a Ruby project that uses RubyGems, it has a Gemfile. Let’s take a look at it.Your application’s Gemfile is a file named…Gemfile. It’s not nested inside any directories, and it’s one of the first files in the bookstore directory.      Open the Gemfile in your text editor.    Woah! Your application’s Gemfile already has some stuff in it!    Turns out your application has been using a Gemfile this whole time.        Your application’s Gemfile is the default Gemfile that ships with all new Rails applications. You can choose different RubyGems, but this default list helps you get started quickly.    If you read through the Gemfile, you might recongize some RubyGems we’ve been using. You might even come across a RubyGem that brought us here in the first place…  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748  source 'http://rubygems.org'  # Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'  gem 'rails', '~&gt; 5.0.0', '&gt;= 5.0.0.1'  # Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record  gem 'sqlite3'  # Use Puma as the app server  gem 'puma', '~&gt; 3.0'  # Use SCSS for stylesheets  gem 'sass-rails', '~&gt; 5.0'  # Use Uglifier as compressor for JavaScript assets  gem 'uglifier', '&gt;= 1.3.0'  # Use CoffeeScript for .coffee assets and views  gem 'coffee-rails', '~&gt; 4.2'  # See https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes  # gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby  # Use jquery as the JavaScript library  gem 'jquery-rails'  # Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster.

Open Terminal and run bundle install.    bundle install goes through each RubyGem in your Gemfile and decides if it needs to install it or not. If your application already has the RubyGem, it will output “Using…” and move on to the next RubyGem.    We’re only adding one RubyGem to your application - bcrypt. When bundle install gets to bcrypt, it will tell you that it’s being installed:    Installing bcrypt 3.1.11 with native extensions            When bundle install finishes, you’ll get a message telling you how many RubyGems your application is using.

No errors 🎉    This assigns a new User with username “CatPower” to my_first_user.    my_first_user has a username, but she doesn’t have a password.    Fortunately, has_secure_password added a method to User so you can set passwords.        Try setting a password for my_first_user by running:    my_first_user.password = \"password\"            Now, try saving my_first_user.    my_first_user.save        Wait…that worked?        &gt;&gt; my_first_user = User.new(username: 'CatPower')  =&gt; #&lt;User id: nil, username: \"CatPower\", password_digest: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;  &gt;&gt; my_first_user.password = 'password'  =&gt; \"password\"  &gt;&gt; my_first_user.save     (0.1ms)  begin transaction    SQL (0.6ms)  INSERT INTO \"users\" (\"username\", \"password_digest\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)

Run my_first_user.password_digest.    That’s not the generic password you were expecting, was it?    has_secure_password transformed the plain text password you set on my_first_user into an encrypted password. Then, the encrypted password was stored in the password_digest column.        Now that you have a user with a password, you can authenticate her.    What do you think will happen when you run the following code?    my_first_user.authenticate(\"password\")        What about if you do something like this instead?    my_first_user.authenticate(\"I'm just guessing\")        Give them a try!    &gt;&gt; my_first_user.password_digest  =&gt; \"$2a$10$T9KFCyIrtgFhBtEixMYm9e757ZXa7UlBVOyaAzCtbwt2rNP5snSle\"      When you run my_first_user.authenticate with my_first_user’s password, authenticate returned the user.    &gt;&gt; my_first_user.authenticate(\"password\")=&gt; #&lt;User id: 1, username: \"CatPower\", password_digest: \"$2a$10$T9KFCyIrtgFhBtEixMYm9e757ZXa7UlBVOyaAzCtbwt...\", created_at: \"2017-01-13 02:57:39\", updated_at: \"2017-01-13 02:57:39\"&gt;            When you run my_first_user.authenticate with an invalid password, authenticate returned false.    &gt;&gt; my_first_user.authenticate(\"bad password\")=&gt; false        &gt;&gt; my_first_user.authenticate(\"password\")  =&gt; #&lt;User id: 1, username: \"CatPower\", password_digest: \"$2a$10$T9KFCyIrtgFhBtEixMYm9e757ZXa7UlBVOyaAzCtbwt...\", created_at: \"2017-01-13 02:57:39\", updated_at: \"2017-01-13 02:57:39\"&gt;  &gt;&gt; my_first_user.authenticate(\"bad password\")  =&gt; false      Yay! Now you can create users, securely store their passwords, and authenticate them.    Exit the rails console and do your happy dance.      ",

        "content": "Logging In and Logging OutYour bookstore has users, but there’s no way for them to login. Let’s change that 😊      Let’s start by looking at your application’s routes file. Open config/routes.rb in your text editor.    You’ve added a couple of resources to the routes file. First, you defined :books. This added a series of routes to your application for creating, reading, updating, and deleting your books. Then, you added another resource :reviews. This added similar routes, but they’re focused on reviews instead of books.    Now that your application has users, it might be tempting to add a :users resource. This would be useful if we were going to change user data, but we don’t need to change any user data to log someone in.    We just need to keep track of a user once they’ve logged in to your bookstore. We’ll represent this as a session - a user creates a new session when they log in.        Let’s add a :session resource to your routes file. Before the end of config/routes.rb, add the following line:    resource :session            Save your changes.  12345678910  Rails.application.routes.draw do    # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html    root \"books#index\"    resources :books do      resources :reviews    end    resource :session  endLet’s see what your application routes look like now.      Open Terminal, go the bookstore directory, and run rake routes.    Aww, your routes are getting so big 😍    When a user logs in, they’re going to create a new session. What path will they visit to create a new session?    They’ll go to /session/new.    new_session GET    /session/new(.:format)                     sessions#new            Start your application’s web server and visit the new session path at http://localhost:3000/session/new.    › pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  › rake routes            Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                                Controller#Action              root GET    /                                          books#index      book_reviews GET    /books/:book_id/reviews(.:format)          reviews#index                   POST   /books/:book_id/reviews(.:format)          reviews#create   new_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/new(.:format)      reviews#new  edit_book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id/edit(.:format) reviews#edit       book_review GET    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#show                   PATCH  /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#update                   PUT    /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#update                   DELETE /books/:book_id/reviews/:id(.:format)      reviews#destroy             books GET    /books(.:format)                           books#index                   POST   /books(.:format)                           books#create          new_book GET    /books/new(.:format)                       books#new         edit_book GET    /books/:id/edit(.:format)                  books#edit              book GET    /books/:id(.:format)                       books#show                   PATCH  /books/:id(.:format)                       books#update                   PUT    /books/:id(.:format)                       books#update                   DELETE /books/:id(.:format)                       books#destroy           session POST   /session(.:format)                         sessions#create       new_session GET    /session/new(.:format)                     sessions#new      edit_session GET    /session/edit(.:format)                    sessions#edit                   GET    /session(.:format)                         sessions#show                   PATCH  /session(.:format)                         sessions#update                   PUT    /session(.:format)                         sessions#update                   DELETE /session(.:format)                         sessions#destroy  › rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000Oh boy, another Routing Error! 😝      The error tells you what’s wrong…    uninitialized constant SessionsController            Fix this familiar error and come back when you get a different one.  Were you able to get past the Routing Error?No worries if you’re stuck, we’ll help you out 😊      You’re getting a Routing Error because you application doesn’t have a SessionsController.    To fix this, you need to create a SessionsController.    All controllers follow a similar pattern. They live inside the app/controllers directory, and they’re filename matches their name.    For example, the SessionsController will be a file named app/controllers/sessions_controller.    Controllers also share the same roots. Do you remember what your BooksController looked like when you first added it?    class BooksControllers &lt; ApplicationControllerend        There wasn’t much to it, remember?        If you didn’t create an empty SessionsController (app/controllers/sessions_controller), go ahead and create now.    class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationControllerend            Then, revisit http://localhost:3000/session/new to see your next error!        Now, you’re getting an Unknown action error. Just like the last error, it’s giving you a hint.    The action 'new' could not be found for SessionsController        You know what to do, right?!            Fix that error. When you’re done, you’ll get one more error.        What did you come up with?! Are you seeing a new error??    You had to add a new method to the SessionsController.    def newend            If you didn’t already add the new method, go ahead and add it now.  1234class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController  def new  endendWe’re sooooo close to the end of the error train.Can you think of reason why you’re getting an ActionController::UnknownFormat error? It looks crazy, but we’ve seen this plenty of times before.You’re getting an ActionController::UnknownFormat error because the SessionsController new action doesn’t have a template.      Fix this error!    Remember, templates for the SessionsController will live inside app/views/sessions.    When you’re done, http://localhost:3000/session/new will render a blank page.        Did you figure out how to add the SessionsController new template?    You had to add a new directory.    mkdir app/views/sessions        Then, you had to create an empty template file named new.html.erb inside app/views/sessions.    touch app/views/sessions/new.html.erb            If you didn’t already, add the empty SessionsController new template file (app/views/sessions/new.html.erb).    If you’re following the steps we just laid out, you’ll have to stop your application’s web server before running the commands. When you’re done, you can restart it.    Ah, has a blank page ever looked so good?  A blank page is great and all, but wouldn’t it be even better if a user could log in?!In the SessionsController new template, we need to render a form where users can enter their credentials to create a new session and log in.      Open app/views/sessions/new.html.erb and add the following:    &lt;%= form_for(:session, url: session_path) do |f| %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        The form_for might look a little familiar. We’ve used it to build forms for adding and updating books, and adding new reviews. However, there are a few differences.    In the past forms you’ve built with form_for, you started by passing an instance of the record you wanted to update or create. For example, the new books form has a new instance of Book.    &lt;%= form_for(@book) do |f| %&gt;        We aren’t doing this for the new session form because we’re not going to save the session in the database. We’re going to save it in the browser (more on that later).    Unlike the other forms, we have to specify a URL for the new session form. form_for can figure out where to send the form data when given an instance of a class; otherwise, you have to expcitily set the URL.    Other than that, the new session form is just like the other forms you’ve built.        Using the new book form in app/views/books/new.html.erb as an example, add two text fields to the new sessions form.    First, add a text field labeled “Username”.    Then, add a text field labeled “Password”.    Finally, add a form submission button.  12  &lt;%= form_for(:session, url: session_path) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;      What does your solution look like? It should look something like this:    &lt;%= form_for(:session, url: session_path) do |f| %&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :username %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :username %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;      &lt;%= f.label :password %&gt;      &lt;%= f.text_field :password %&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            Update your solution to match this solution. Save your changes and take a look at the form by visiting http://localhost:3000/session/new.  123456789101112131415  &lt;%= form_for(:session, url: session_path) do |f| %&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= f.label :username %&gt;        &lt;%= f.text_field :username %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= f.label :password %&gt;        &lt;%= f.text_field :password %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;Yay! The form looks so good!!But you might’ve noticed a couple of…weird things.First, did you try typing anything in the “Password” field. It shows up as plain text! That’s not great if we’re trying to protect passwords. Fortunately, we can change this behavior.Also, the form submission button doesn’t have the friendliest message. “Save Session” is technically right, but most users probably expect to see something like “Login”.Let’s make these things better!First, we can change the “Password” field from a text field to a password field.      Reopen app/views/sessions/new.html.erb and change    &lt;%= f.text_field :password %&gt;        to    &lt;%= f.password_field :password %&gt;            Now, let’s change the text of the form submission button to “Login”. Change    &lt;%= f.submit(class: \"button\") %&gt;        to    &lt;%= f.submit(\"Login\", class: \"button\") %&gt;            Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/session/new, and try logging in!    You should have a user with username “CatPower” and a password of “password”.  …You know how to deal with Unknown action errors, right?!      Fix this error!    When you’re done, submitting the form shouldn’t do anything.        How did you get past that Unknown action error?    You added an empty create method to the SessionsController, right?    def createend            If you didn’t already, add an empty create method to the SessionsController.  1234567  class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new    end    def create    end  endNothing happens when you try to login, but how could anything happen. The new session form is being submitted to the SessionsController create method, and that method is empty.Let’s update the create method so users can login.      Just like past forms, the new session form data is available in the SessionsController inside the params hash. If you take a look at your application’s web server’s output, you can see the params coming in.    Parameters: {\"utf8\"=&gt;\"✓\", \"authenticity_token\"=&gt;\"C2s/BLrDEpUMmOL+FMx6SqNzLTqKvcLlvpw32+lD2O32Aryi9Kt0tlWVM+gUS3DYhQt1+3q0Tn3kqakWdZylVw==\", \"session\"=&gt;{\"username\"=&gt;\"CatPower\", \"password\"=&gt;\"[FILTERED]\"}, \"commit\"=&gt;\"Login\"}        The form data is tucked in the session hash, and it includes a username and password.    We can use the form data with the authenticate method to log users in.        First, we’ll need to find the user by their username. Add the following code inside the create method:    user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])        find_by is a handy method that let’s us get records from your database with something other than an id. We’re using find_by here to get the user by their username.        Now that we have the user’s record, we can check if they’ve given us a valid password. Add the following code to the create mehtod:    if user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])  flash[:notice] = \"Welcome back, #{user.username}!\"  session[:user_id] = user.id  redirect_to root_pathelse  flash[:alert] = \"Sorry, your username or password is invalid.\"  render :newend        First, we’ll try to authenticate the user. If the user is successfully authenticated, we’ll          show them a success message      save their id in the browser’s session as user_id      send them to the root_path        If the user cannot be authenticated, we’ll          show them a failure message      re-render the new template so they can try logging in again            There’s a lot happening here, so let’s try to break it down to get a better feel for what each of these lines of code is doing.    Before we continue, save your changes.  12345678910111213141516  class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new    end    def create      user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])      if user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])        flash[:notice] = \"Welcome back, #{user.username}!\"        session[:user_id] = user.id        redirect_to root_path      else        flash[:alert] = \"Sorry, your username or password is invalid.\"        render :new      end    end  endThe Rails SessionLet’s start by looking at this line:session[:user_id] = user.idRails saves a session for every user that visits your application. By default, these sessions are stored in the user’s browser using something called cookies. Cookies are small files that browsers can use to save data on a user’s machine.To protect the session’s contents, Rails signs and encrypts it so the contents are only accessible by the Rails application.Rails makes the session available as a session hash. You can save anything inside the session hash. For example, we decided to store a user_id.session[:user_id] = user.idSessions are probably feeling really abstract right now, but they’ll make more sense when you see them in action.Flash MessagesIn the create method, we also made use of the flash.flash[:notice] = \"Welcome back, #{user.username}!\"flash[:alert] = \"Sorry, your username or password is invalid.\"The flash is also part of the session, but it doesn’t get saved in the user’s browser. Instead, the flash is cleared after every request.We can take advantage of the flash’s short life cycle to temporarily show messages. For example, imagine what happens after you a user logs in to your bookstore. It’s nice to see the welcome back message, but you don’t really need continue seeing that message as you make your rounds through the bookstore.Just like the session, the flash is made available in your application as a flash hash. You can also store anything in the flash, but it’s commonly used to save things like notices and alerts.In the create method, you’re putting the succes message in flash[:notice] and the failure message is flash[:alert]. To show these messages, we need to make a change to your application’s layout template.      Open app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.        Before the container div, add the following lines:    &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;  &lt;p class=\"notice\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;% if flash[:alert] %&gt;  &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:alert] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        If anything is inside flash[:notice] or flash[:alert], we’ll render their contents.        Save your changes.  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Bookstore&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;      &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;      &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;        &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"notice\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:alert] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:alert] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;        &lt;%= yield %&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;Now that you have a fully functional create method, let’s take it out for a spin!      Go to http://localhost:3000/session/new and try logging in with an invalid username.    …      This error is a little tricky. Remember when we used find_by in the SessionsController create method to get the user by their username?user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])find_by will return the user only if a user with that username exists. Otherwise, it returns nil. So when you try to log in with an invalid username, user becomes nil.That’s why you’re seeing the NoMethodError - you can’t call authenticate on nil.To fix this error, we’ll need to make a change in the create method.      Open app/views/controllers/sessions_controller.rb. Inside the create method change    if user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])        to    if user &amp;&amp; user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])        With this change, user.authenticate will only be called if the user exists.        Save your changes, revisit http://localhost:3000/session/new, and try logging in with an invalid username again.  1234567891011121314151617  class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new    end    def create      user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])      if user &amp;&amp; user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])        flash[:notice] = \"Welcome back, #{user.username}!\"        session[:user_id] = user.id        redirect_to root_path      else        flash[:alert] = \"Sorry, your username or password is invalid.\"        render :new      end    end  endYay! That’s a lot better, isn’t it?      Now try logging in as “CatPower”, but use an invalid password. You should still get the failure message.        Finally, try logging in as “CatPower” using “password” as the password.  YAYAY!!!      Try clicking around the bookstore.    The success message should go way as soon as you visit a new page.  Now that you’re logged in, let’s make it so you can log out!Let’s add a “Log out” link to your bookstore’s header.      Open app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. Change the “navigation” div from    &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;  &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;    &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        to:    &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;  &lt;div class=\"left\"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;    &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;    &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        Inside the “navigation” div, we’re adding two divs: a “left” div and a “right” div. The “left” div is there to just keep things aligned. The “right” div is really the one we’re interested in.    In the “right” div, we’re adding a “Log Out” link. When the link is clicked, it will send a DELETE request to the session_path (/session).        Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the new “Log Out” link.    What do you think will happen if you try logging out? Give it a try 🙃  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Bookstore&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;      &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;      &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;        &lt;div class=\"left\"&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"notice\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:alert] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:alert] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;        &lt;%= yield %&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;      Since the “Log Out” link sends a DELETE request, it gets routed to the SessionsController destroy method. Whelp, that explains the error you’re seeing.    The action 'destroy' could not be found for SessionsController            Let’s create the destroy method. Open the SessionsController (app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb), and add the following method:    def destroy  session[:user_id] = nil  flash[:notice] = \"See ya next time!\"  redirect_to root_pathend        The first line of this method removes the user_id we saved in the session by setting session[:user_id] to nil. The second line shows a friendly message confirming the user has been logged out. The final line redirects the user to the root_path.        Save your changes and try logging out! After you’ve logged out, stop your application’s web server.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223  class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController    def new    end    def create      user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])      if user &amp;&amp; user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])        flash[:notice] = \"Welcome back, #{user.username}!\"        session[:user_id] = user.id        redirect_to root_path      else        flash[:alert] = \"Sorry, your username or password is invalid.\"        render :new      end    end    def destroy      session[:user_id] = nil      flash[:notice] = \"See ya next time!\"      redirect_to root_path    end  end",

We’ll only show the “Log Out” link to users who are logged in.How Do We Know If a User is Logged In or Not?If we only want to show the “Log Out” link to logged in users, we first have to figure out if a user is logged in or not. Fortunately, we already have the parts in place to figure this out.After a user successfully logs in, you’re saving their user id in the session. You did this in the SessionsController create method.def create  user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])  if user &amp;&amp; user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])    ...    session[:user_id] = user.id    ...  else    ...  endendWhen a user logs out, you remove their user id from the session. You did this in the SessionsController destroy method.def destroy  session[:user_id] = nil  ...endWe can tell if a user is logged in or not by checking in the session. If a user id is present, we know that user is logged in. Otherwise, no one is logged in.We’ve only used the session in your controllers, but it’s also avaialble in your templates. Let’s see what we can do with it.Before we get to far, you’ll need to log in again.      Open Terminal and go to the bookstore directory.        Now, start you application’s web server.        Go to http://localhost:3000/session/new and log in as “CatPower” with password “password”.    › pwd  /Users/alimi/Projects/bookstore  › rails server  =&gt; Booting Puma  =&gt; Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000Now that you’re logged in, we can start making some changes 😊      Open app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.        Above the “Log Out” link, add the following line:    &lt;p&gt; Hi, my user id is &lt;%= session[:user_id] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;        The same session hash you used in the SessionsController is also available here in this template.    With this change, you’re going to show what user id is saved in the session. Since you’re logged in as “CatPower”, it’s going to show CatPower’s user id.        Save your changes and revist http://localhost:3000.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Bookstore&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;      &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;      &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;        &lt;div class=\"left\"&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;          &lt;p&gt; Hi, my user id is &lt;%= session[:user_id] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"notice\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:alert] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:alert] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;        &lt;%= yield %&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;Sweet! Now that we know how to access the session in your templates, let’s put it to use.      Reopen app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.        Change the “Log Out” link and its parent div from    &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Hi, my user id is &lt;%= session[:user_id] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        to    &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;  &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;    &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;  &lt;% else %&gt;    I'm not logged in  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        If a user_id is set in the session, we’ll show the “Log Out” link. Otherwise, we’ll just show “I’m not logged in”.        Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000. Log out and you should no longer see the “Log Out” link.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Bookstore&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;      &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;      &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;        &lt;div class=\"left\"&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;          &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;            &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;          &lt;% else %&gt;            I'm not logged in          &lt;% end %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"notice\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:alert] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:alert] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;        &lt;%= yield %&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;Progress!Now that we aren’t showing the “Log Out” link to logged out users, let’s show them a “Login” link instead.      In app/views/layouts/application.html.erb, replace “I’m not logged in” with a link labeled “Login”. The link should go to the new_session path.    Use the other links in the template as examples.        What does your link look like? It should look something like this:    &lt;%= link_to \"Log In\", new_session_path %&gt;            If you didn’t already, add the “Log In” link. Save your changes, revist http://localhost:3000, and try logging in!  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Bookstore&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;      &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;      &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div class=\"navigation\"&gt;        &lt;div class=\"left\"&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"center\"&gt;          &lt;%= link_to \"My Super Rad Bookstore\", root_path %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class=\"right\"&gt;          &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;            &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;          &lt;% else %&gt;            &lt;%= link_to \"Log In\", new_session_path %&gt;          &lt;% end %&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"notice\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;% if flash[:alert] %&gt;        &lt;p class=\"alert\"&gt; &lt;%= flash[:alert] %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;        &lt;%= yield %&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;If you’re anything like me, you probably tried to log out just as soon as you logged in so you could see the link change back and forth.But if you’re not like me, give it a try! You’ve got to appreciate the small things in life 😝You might also notice that the “Log Out”/”Login” links are on every page of your bookstore.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb is the main layout file of your application, and it’s used by every template in your bookstore. Since we added the links to this layout, they will get rendered on every page.Now that we have logged in and logged out users, can you think of things logged out users shouldn’t be able to do?I can think of one - logged out users shouldn’t be able to add books. This is your super rad bookstore after all. You don’t want some random person to come along and start adding books to your bookstore.      Open app/views/books/index.html.erb and find the “Add a book” link.    Take some time and try updating the template so the “Add a book” link is only visible to logged in users. Logged out users shouldn’t see anything.        What does your solution look like? It should look a lot like the code you used to show the “Log Out” link.    &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path, class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        The difference here is we don’t have an else statement. Before, we wanted to show a “Login” link to logged out users.    &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to \"Log Out\", session_path, method: :delete %&gt;&lt;% else %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to \"Log In\", new_session_path %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        Now, we don’t want to show anything to logged out users. Therefore, we don’t need the else statement.        Update your solution to match this solution and save your changes.        Go to http://localhost:3000, and switch between being logged in and logged out.    When you log out, the “Add a book” link will disappear…      12345678910111213  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Super Rad Bookstore!&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @books.each do |book| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt;        &lt;%= link_to(book.title, book_path(book)) %&gt; by &lt;%= book.author %&gt;      &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;    &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a book\", new_book_path, class: \"button\") %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;Can you think of other things logged out users shouldn’t be able to do?Right now, if you go to a book’s page, anyone can edit, review, or delete a book. I wouldn’t want to give such broad powers to anyone in my super rad bookstore, and you shouldn’t either!      Open app/views/books/show.html.erb. At the end of the template, you have links to edit a book and add a review. You also have a button to delete a book.    &lt;%= link_to(\"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;%= link_to(\"Add a Review\", new_book_review_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;        Update the template so the links and button are only available to logged in users.        What did you come up with? Maybe you did something like this:    &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a Review\", new_book_review_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;  &lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;        This works really well, but doesn’t it feel a little repetitive? We’re using the same condition for all three elements to decide if they should be rendered or not.    You can simplify things a bit with something like this:    &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;  &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a Review\", new_book_review_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;  &lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;            If you don’t have a similar solution, update your solution to match the last solution.        Save your changes and check out the book details page as a logged in and logged out user.  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents / 100.0) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Description&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.description %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Number of reviews: &lt;%= @book.reviews.count %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @book.reviews.each do |review| %&gt;      &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;    &lt;%= link_to(\"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;    &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a Review\", new_book_review_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;    &lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;Alright, I think we’ve hidden everything we need to hide from logged out users. Your bookstore is super secure now, right?!      Make sure you’re logged out and try going to http://localhost:3000/books/new.    Anyone can add books!        We made it more difficult for logged out users to mess with your bookstore, but that won’t stop them if they can figure out the paths to go to.    We can stop mischievous users from snooping around by checking for logged out users in your controllers.  Let’s start by looking at the BooksController new method.The session is available to us in all of our controllers. Let’s use it to check if a user is logged in. If they’re logged in, we can do what we’ve always been doing. Otherwise, let’s redirect the user to the login page.      Open app/controllers/books_controller.rb. Change the new method from    def new  @book = Book.newend        to    def new  if session[:user_id].blank?    flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"    redirect_to new_session_path  else    @book = Book.new  endend        If a user is logged in, their user id will be in the session. If their user id is not in the session, we’ll add a flash message and send them to the new_session_path. Otherwise, we’ll continue with the method’s previous behavior.        Save your changes and revist http://localhost:3000/books/new. You should now be redirected to the login page.  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      if session[:user_id].blank?        flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"        redirect_to new_session_path      else        @book = Book.new      end    end    def create      Book.create(book_params)      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(book_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def book_params      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)    end    def destroy      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.destroy      redirect_to books_path    end  endAdding More Restrictions to the BooksControllerNow that we have this check in place, we should probably add them to a few more of the BooksController methods.index and show should be available to all users, but logged out users shouldn’t have access to create, edit, update, or destroy.One solution to this problem would be to copy the check we added to the new method to the rest of the methods we want to secure. This would work, but copying code is suprisingly time consuming. Fortunately, Rails has a method that will help us out.      Open the BooksController. Just after the beginning of the controller, add the following line:    before_action :verify_user_session        Before every method in the BooksController, Rails will first call verify_user_session.        If you try to go to http://localhost:3000/books/new now, you’ll get an error. Can you guess why?    We haven’t defined a verify_user_session method!        At the end of the BooksController, add the verify_user_session method:    def verify_user_session  if session[:user_id].blank?    flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"    redirect_to new_session_path  endend        This should look very familiar. It’s the same logic you used in the new method!    def new  if session[:user_id].blank?    flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"    redirect_to new_session_path  else    @book = Book.new  endend        Since you’re doing the check in verify_user_session, you don’t need it in the new method anymore. Remove the check so the new method is back to its old self.    def new  @book = Book.newend            Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000/books/new. You should still be redirected to the login page.    Try visiting another page like the edit book page. For example, if you still have your first book you can go to http://localhost:3000/books/1/edit. Once again, you should be redirected to the login page.  123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    before_action :verify_user_session    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(book_params)      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(book_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def book_params      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)    end    def destroy      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.destroy      redirect_to books_path    end    def verify_user_session      if session[:user_id].blank?        flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"        redirect_to new_session_path      end    end  end      Now that we have all this security in place, log out and visit http://localhost:3000.        We made the BooksController a little too secure 😅    Remember, logged out users should still be able to access the BooksController index and show methods.        Open the BooksController. After the before_action, add the following line:    skip_before_action :verify_user_session, only: [:index, :show]        This tells Rails to skip the before_action that calls verify_user_session for the index and show methods.        Save your changes and revisit http://localhost:3000.    Now that you’re back in, try going directly to a book’s detail page. For example, you could go to http://localhost:3000/books/1.        Try visiting different paths directly as logged in and logged out users. The book index and details page should be available to both, but only logged in users can reach things like the edit book page.  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849  class BooksController &lt; ApplicationController    before_action :verify_user_session    skip_before_action :verify_user_session, only: [:index, :show]    def index      @books = Book.all    end    def show      @id = params[:id]      @book = Book.find(@id)    end    def new      @book = Book.new    end    def create      Book.create(book_params)      redirect_to books_path    end    def edit      @book = Book.find(params[:id])    end    def update      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.update(book_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def book_params      params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author, :price_cents, :quantity, :description)    end    def destroy      book = Book.find(params[:id])      book.destroy      redirect_to books_path    end    def verify_user_session      if session[:user_id].blank?        flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"        redirect_to new_session_path      end    end  endNow that we have the BooksController locked down, let’s add the same checks to the ReviewsController.      Open the ReviewsController (app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb).        Using the BooksController as an example, add a before_action to the ReviewsController that calls verify_user_session before each of the controller’s methods.    verify_user_session should redirect logged out users to the new_session path so they can login.        How did you change the ReviewsController. The before_action line should’ve been a spitting image of the before_action line from the BooksController.    before_action :verify_user_session        What about the verify_user_session method? It should also be a spitting image 😊    def verify_user_session  if session[:user_id].blank?    flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"    redirect_to new_session_path  endend            If you didn’t already, add the before_action and the verify_user_session method to the ReviewsController.        Save your changes and trying visting a new review page as both a logged out and logged in user. For example, you would add a new review for your first book by visiting http://localhost:3000/books/1/reviews/new.        When you’re done exploring all your changes, stop your application’s web server.  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    before_action :verify_user_session    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end    def create      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      book.reviews.create(review_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def review_params      params.require(:review).permit(:body)    end    def verify_user_session      if session[:user_id].blank?        flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"        redirect_to new_session_path      end    end  end",

        "content": "Associating Reviews with UsersNow that you can keep track of logged in users, you can keep track of their actions. A great example where this could be useful is with your reviews. Wouldn’t it be nice to know which users are leaving which reviews?Has Many RelationshipsTo track which users are leaving which reviews, we need to establish a relationship between users and reviews.A user can leave many reviews, and a review can only be written by one user. Does this sound familiar?You’ve already defined a similar relaltionship between books and reviews.class Book &lt; ApplicationRecord  has_many :reviewsendclass Review &lt; ApplicationRecord  belongs_to :bookendA book has many reviews, and a review belongs to a book.      Open the User class (app/models/user.rb) in your text editor.    Using the Book class as an example, update User so a user has many reviews.        What do your changes look like? You should have added the following line to User:    has_many :reviews            If you didn’t already, make this change to User.        Save your changes.  12345  class User &lt; ApplicationRecord    has_secure_password    has_many :reviews  endNow that we’ve defined a relationship between users and reviews, let’s see what we can do with it on the rails console.      Open Terminal, make sure you’re in the bookstore directory, and start the rails console.        Find your first user and assign it to a variable called my_first_user.        Now, try running my_first_user.reviews.    Yikes! That looks like a gnarly error… 😅    The ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid error is giving you hint to what’s going on. Burried inside the error, you have this message:    no such column: reviews.user_id        We’ve defined the relationship between users and reviews on the model level, but we haven’t defined it on the database level.    Since we said a user can have many reviews, Rails is expecting the reviews table to have a user_id column. Let’s add it!        Before you continue, exit the rails console.    $ pwd  /Users/awesomesauce/Projects/bookstore  $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; my_first_user = User.first    User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"users\".* FROM \"users\" ORDER BY \"users\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT ?

[[\"user_id\", 1]]  ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: reviews.user_id: SELECT \"reviews\".* FROM \"reviews\" WHERE \"reviews\".\"user_id\" = ?  ...  &gt;&gt; exitTo add a user_id column to the reviews table, we’ll need to create a new migration.      In Terminal, run the following command:    rails generate migration add_user_id_to_reviews        This will generate a new timestamped migration file named AddUserIdtoReviews. It’s filename will be something along the lines of db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_add_user_id_to_reviews.rb    $ rails generate migration add_user_id_to_reviews        invoke  active_record        create    db/migrate/20170124223830_add_user_id_to_reviews.rb      The AddUserIdtoReviews migration will be very similiar to another migration you’ve created. Can you think of which one?    AddUserIdtoReviews is gonna look a lot like AddBookIdToReviews.    class AddBookIdToReviews &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]  def change    add_column :reviews, :book_id, :integer  endend        You added a book_id column to the reviews table because you wanted to define the relationship between books and reviews on the database level. Remember, a book can have many reviews.    We want to do the same thing in AddUserIdtoReviews, except we’re adding a user_id to reviews.        Using this as an example, update the change method of the AddUserIdtoReviews migration to add a user_id column to the reviews table. The user_id column should be an integer column.    class AddUserIdToReviews &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change    end  end      What does your change look like? You should’ve added the following line to the change method:    add_column :reviews, :user_id, :integer            If you didn’t already, add this line, save your changes, and run the migration.    class AddUserIdToReviews &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]    def change      add_column :reviews, :user_id, :integer    end  endNow that we’ve defined the relationship between users and reviews on both the model and the database levels, we can go back to exploring the relationship on the rails console.      Go to Terminal and start the rails console.        Assign your first user to a variable called my_first_user.        Now, try running my_first_user.reviews.    You get an empty collection because my_first_user doesn’t have any reviews. Let’s change that!    $ rails console  Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)  &gt;&gt; my_first_user = User.first    User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"users\".* FROM \"users\" ORDER BY \"users\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT ?

[[\"user_id\", 1]]  =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []&gt;      Assign your first book to a variable called my_first_book.        Now, run the following code to create a new review for my_first_book that will also be associated with my_first_user.    my_first_book.reviews.create(body: \"This review was written by a user!\", user_id: my_first_user.id)        On the new review, we’re setting a body and a user_id.    By setting the user_id to my_first_user’s id, we’ll know that the review belongs to my_first_user.    &gt;&gt; my_first_book = Book.first    Book Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  \"books\".* FROM \"books\" ORDER BY \"books\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT ?

I thought my_first_user would have reviews 😔    But my_first_user does have reviews!        Do you remember when you assigned the first user in your database to my_first_user?    my_first_user = User.first        It’s been a while - it was the first thing you did when you entered the rails console.    my_first_user is a variable, and it only knows about the data that existed when it was defined. Even though your first user now has a review in the database, the variable my_first_user doesn’t know anything about it.        To update my_first_user with the new review data, run:    my_first_user.reload            Now, try running my_first_user.reviews.    🎉    &gt;&gt; my_first_user.reviews  =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []&gt;  &gt;&gt; my_first_user.reload    User Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  \"users\".* FROM \"users\" WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = ?

Run the following code to assign the new review to a variable called my_last_review:    my_last_review = Review.last            my_last_review should have a user_id. Try running my_last_review.user_id.    This will return the user_id of the user who’s associated to my_last_review. Since we set it to my_first_user’s id, it will most likely be 1.        Now, let’s try to get the user from the review. Try running my_last_review.user.    Hmm…that’s an interesting error. Any thoughts on why you got a NoMethodError.    (The hint is in the error)    You got a NoMethodError because we haven’t completely defined the relationship between users and reviews. You defined part of the relationship - a user has many reviews. However, you haven’t defined the relationship between reviews and users.    &gt;&gt; my_last_review = Review.last    Review Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"reviews\".* FROM \"reviews\" ORDER BY \"reviews\".\"id\" DESC LIMIT ?

Open app/models/reviews.rb. You might notice another relationship we already defined 😉    Since a review also belongs to a book, you previously added this line:    belongs_to :book        Now, we need to do the same thing for users.        Update Review so a review belongs_to a user.  123  class Review &lt; ApplicationRecord    belongs_to :book  endThat probably sounded more challenging than it was 😅      You should’ve added this line    belongs_to :user            If you didn’t already, add this line to Review and save your changes.  1234  class Review &lt; ApplicationRecord    belongs_to :book    belongs_to :user  endNow, let’s see if we can’t get your last review’s user.      Go back to the rails console and run the following line to pull in your changes.    reload!            Get your last review again and assign it to my_last_review.

But do you remember how users create reviews?Users create reviews by submitting forms to the ReviewsController create method. Let’s take a look at it.In your text editor, open the ReviewsController (app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb) and find the create method.def create  book = Book.find(params[:book_id])  book.reviews.create(review_params)  redirect_to book_path(book)endIt’s been a while since you added this method, so let’s do a quick review.In the create method, you start by finding the book that’s being reviewed.book = Book.find(params[:book_id])Then, you create a new review for it using review_params.book.reviews.create(review_params)review_params is a method that defines which of the form’s fields can be set on the new review.def review_params  params.require(:review).permit(:body)endUsing strong parameters, you set up the review_params method so the form must submit a review hash. The only field you’re permitting in that hash is the body field.Now, we need to update review_params so we can also set user_id.But how do we know what the user_id should be?Only logged in users can create new reviews, and we know which user is logged in because their user id is saved in the session as user_id.We’ll have to change the review_params method so it lets us set user_id to the user_id saved in the session…      In the ReviewsController, change the review_params method from    def review_params  params.require(:review).permit(:body)end        to    def review_params  permitted_params = params.require(:review).permit(:body)  permitted_params.merge(user_id: session[:user_id])end        We’re still using strong parameters to restrict which form fields can get set on a new review, but we’ll assign them to a new variable called permitted_params.    Then, we’ll use the merge method to add user_id to permitted_params.    user_id will be set to session[:user_id].        Save your changes and start your application’s web server.        Now, login and write a new book review!  1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526  class ReviewsController &lt; ApplicationController    before_action :verify_user_session    def new      @book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      @review = @book.reviews.build    end    def create      book = Book.find(params[:book_id])      book.reviews.create(review_params)      redirect_to book_path(book)    end    def review_params      permitted_params = params.require(:review).permit(:body)      permitted_params.merge(user_id: session[:user_id])    end    def verify_user_session      if session[:user_id].blank?        flash[:alert] = \"Please login to continue\"        redirect_to new_session_path      end    end  end      Did you write a really inspiring review?? 😉    Let’s take a look at it on the rails console.        Stop your application’s web server and start the rails console.        Now, get your last review and assign it to a variable called my_last_review.        Let’s see who write your last review…    Run my_last_review.user.    Yay!

Do you remember where reviews are shown?    In your text editor, open app/views/books/show.html.erb.        Towards the end of the template, you’re showing all of a books reviews in an unordered list. Let’s include review usernames in the unordered list.    Change the reviews unordered list from    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;% @book.reviews.each do |review| %&gt;    &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        to    &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;% @book.reviews.each do |review| %&gt;    &lt;% if(review.user.present?) %&gt;      &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= review.user.username %&gt; - &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% else %&gt;      &lt;li&gt; Anonymous - &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;        We’ll show the usernames for reviews who have users. However, you probably have some older reviews in your database that don’t have users. When that happens, we’ll show “Anonymous” instead.        Save your changes and visit a book with reviews. You should see a mix of anonymous and not so anonymous users that have left behind some reviews 😊        Try adding new reviews. If you’re still logged in as “CatPower”, she’ll start getting a lot of reviews in her name…        When you’re done, stop your application’s web server.  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637  &lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Id&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Title&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.title %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Author&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.author %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Price&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= number_to_currency(@book.price_cents / 100.0) %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Quantity&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.quantity %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Description&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @book.description %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;/dl&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Number of reviews: &lt;%= @book.reviews.count %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;% @book.reviews.each do |review| %&gt;      &lt;% if(review.user.present?) %&gt;        &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= review.user.username %&gt; - &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;      &lt;% else %&gt;        &lt;li&gt; Anonymous - &lt;%= review.body %&gt; &lt;/li&gt;      &lt;% end %&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;% if session[:user_id].present? %&gt;    &lt;%= link_to(\"Edit book\", edit_book_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;    &lt;%= link_to(\"Add a Review\", new_book_review_path(@book), class: \"button\") %&gt;    &lt;%= button_to(\"Delete Book\", book_path(@book), method: :delete, class: \"button danger\") %&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt;",

Give users the ability to edit their reviews.        Let users delete their reviews.        Show when reviews were created or last edited.        Show a listing of reviews by a given user.        Add images to books. You’re not supposed to judge a book by it’s cover…but sometimes it helpful. 😉    To add images to books, you will need to use a RubyGem like Paperclip.  These are just a few ideas. Feel free to be creative and come up with your own features. This is your bookstore - I can’t tell you what to do…anymore.Don’t go off into the big, wide world of programming on your own. Even the most seasoned programmer needs a helping hand every once in a  while.      Join B’more on Rails.    B’more on Rails is a community of folks in and around Baltimore who happen to like Rails. 😊    We have Meetups three times a month (if it’s a Tuesday, there’s probably a Meetup 😝)    Come to the Meetups to get to know other people who are also into Rails. You might meet people like yourself who are just getting started, or you might meet someone who has been working with Rails for a while. We have a pretty good mix of backgrounds and experiences.        Join B’more on Rails on Slack.    If you haven’t heard of Slack, it’s kinda like a big group text but bigger.        Slack is a casual place to hangout and chat. It’s also a great place to ask questions. 😊  There are a ton of resources available online for anyone who’s looking to learn Ruby, Rails, or just about programming. Here are few resources we recommend.      Ruby Monk    This is a great series of small and free tutorials for learning more about the Ruby programming languages!        The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl    This tutorial is a much more in depth guide into developing web applications with Rails.    Note: since you already have Rails installed on your computer, you don’t need to use Cloud9 for you development environment.        The Odin Project    The Odin Project offers a series of courses around web development. Along with courses on Ruby and Rails, they have courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  ",
