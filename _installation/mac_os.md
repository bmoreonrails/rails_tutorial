## Minimum Requirements
In order to successfully follow these installation instructions, you must have the following:

* Mac OS X Lion (10.7)
* Administrator user with the rights to change the computer properties

To check the version of your Mac OS X, go to the &#63743; menu and select "About This Mac".
{% endprotip %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
## Open Terminal  
We're going to do these tasks via the Terminal. 

To open Terminal, first go to your Applications directory. Then, open the Utilities directory. Once you're there, you should see the Terminal app. Double click it to open it.

## Install Command-line tools

When you are installing ruby and ruby gems (libraries), your system will often need to compile code for you.  The compilers for this can be installed with XCode, the development tool suite for native macOs development.  

For this tutorial, you only need to install XCode's command line tools.

If you aren't sure if you need this, try typing `gcc` in a terminal window. (`gcc` is the name of the compiler and stands for GNU Compiler Collection). 

If you receive the below dialog saying the "gcc" tool needs to be installed, click "Install".

![Install command line tools now?]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/install_tools_now_dialog.png)

**Alternatively**, if you get the message, `-bash: gcc: command not found`, or if you cancel out of the dialog, install the command-line tools with this command: `xcode-select --install`

This will download the command-line tools and install them.  Once installed, `gcc --version` should print out some information about the compiler.
{% endlist %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ gcc --version

# After installing, check the gcc --version again.
# You should get the below message:

Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1

# Install Homebrew
Homebrew allows you to install and manage applications through your terminal, and it's what we'll be using to download RVM.

To do this, you'll need to go to [Homebrew's website](http://brew.sh/) and copy and past the command that is given into your terminal prompt. 

This command uses [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) which is a command line tool for downloading information over the internet from your terminal. Normally this would not be advised but Homebrew is a very reputible source and used by millions of engineers around the world. So - trust us on this one :-)  

After you type in the command, the script will show what you're downloading and then ask for your computer password. Enter in your computer password when prompted. Note that you'r password will not show up when you type it - that's normal. Just type it and press enter. 
{% endlist %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw....)"

# ==> This script will install:
# /usr/local/bin/brew
# /usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
# /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
# /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew

## Install RVM
The [Ruby Version Manager (rvm)](http://rvm.io/) will allow you to install different versions of ruby on your machine and switch between them as you switch from one project to another. [Learn why RVM is useful here](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/why-you-should-use-rvm--net-19529).

{% protip %}
Note, if you already have the `rbenv` ruby manager installed, do not install `rvm` (they don't play nice together!). 

You can check by typing `rbenv --version` in your terminal.
{% endprotip %}

To install rvm, open a terminal window and run the following commands (copied directly off of the RVM website).

`brew install gpg`

`gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3`

`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

`source /Users/[Computer Username]/.rvm/scripts/rvm`

Once installed RVM will say:
```
Installation of RVM in /Users/[Computer Username]/.rvm/ is almost complete:

* To start using RVM you need to run `source /Users/[Computer Username]/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
  in all your open shell windows, in rare cases you need to reopen all shell windows.
```
Follow those instructions and copy the command and past into your terminal and press enter.
Now you'll be able to install Ruby!

{% endlist %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ brew install gpg  # only necessary if gpg is not already installed

$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

$ source /Users/[Computer Username]/.rvm/scripts/rvm # check what's outputted from previous command

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
## Install Ruby 2.3.1
Now that you have RVM installed, you can use it to install Ruby.  You simply call `rvm install <version>`.  Let's install the latest version (as of 12/3/2016), v2.3.1.

To verify you're using the correct Ruby version, type `ruby -v`. You should have 2.3.1 as the version.

Finally, we'll install bundler, which will manage all your Ruby gems.
{% endlist %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ rvm install 2.3.1

$ rvm default use 2.3.1

$ ruby -v
# => ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-darwin15]

$ gem install bundler
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
## Install Rails 5.0.1

Now that ruby is installed, installing rails is simple.  Just install Rails with the gem command!

If that succeeds, you should be able to run rails on the command-line:
{% endlist %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install rails -v 5.0.1 --no-document

$ rails --version
# Rails 5.0.1
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% protip %}
Note, adding `--no-document` prevents the generation of local (offline) documentation.  If you later decide you want local docs, you can easily recreate them (although it can be a slow process).  Look [here](http://blog.honeybadger.io/how-to-globally-disable-rdoc-and-ri-during-gem-installs/) for more details.
{% endprotip %}


{% steps %}
{% list %}
## Test it out

Now that we have everything we need installed, let's try it out.

After you type all the commands, you should see Rails starting up at the start of the line `Booting Puma`. Once you see `Listening on tcp://localhost:3000`, Rails is now running!
{% endlist %}
{% highlight bash %}
  $ rails new test_rails

  $ cd test_rails

  $ rails server
  => Booting Puma
  => Rails 5.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
  => Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
  Puma starting in single mode...
  * Version 3.6.2 (ruby 2.3.1-p112), codename: Sleepy Sunday Serenity
  * Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
  * Environment: development
  * Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
  Use Ctrl-C to stop
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% aside %}
If you see the output above, rails is running and you can point your browser at http://localhost:3000 and you should see this:

![Yay! You're on Rails!]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/youre_on_rails.png){: .screenshot}

This is not the directory you'll be using in the tutorial. To remove this simply type `rm -rf test_rails`.
{% endaside %}
